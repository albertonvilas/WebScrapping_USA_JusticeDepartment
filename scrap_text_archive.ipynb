Wainstein and Scott N.\\r\\nSchools U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California.', 'The defendant entered into a plea agreement whereby he pleaded guilty to Count\\r\\nFive (EEA) and Count Seven (AECA) of a superseding indictment that had been\\r\\nfiled on December 13, 2006.', 'Count Five charged that Meng violated the EEA by possessing a trade secret\\r\\nbelonging to Quantum3D, a San Jose company by whom he was formerly employed,\\r\\nintending and knowing that this possession would benefit a foreign government,\\r\\ninstrumentality, or agent, namely the Peoples Republic of China (\"PRC\") Navy\\r\\nResearch Center.', 'The trade secret at issue, known as \"Mantis,\" is a Quantum3D product used to\\r\\nsimulate real world motion for military training purposes. Meng installed a\\r\\ndemonstration unit of Mantis on the PRC Navy site. Meng also altered Mantis to\\r\\nmake it appear as if it belonged to ORAD, Mengs new employer, a competitor of\\r\\nQuantum3D based in PRC. This altered version of Mantis was included as part of\\r\\nthe demonstration project in the PRC.', 'Count Seven charged that defendant Meng knowingly and willfully violated the\\r\\nAECA and ITAR when he exported \"viXsen\" source code, a Quantum 3D product that\\r\\nis a designated defense article on the United States Munitions List, and for\\r\\nwhich Meng had no Department of State export license. viXsen is a visual\\r\\nsimulation software program used for training military fighter pilots.', 'United States Attorney Scott N.

      "['', 'BANGKOK, THAILAND  The U.S. Department of Justice today announced the opening\\r\\nof a regional conference of approximately 70 key law enforcement officials from\\r\\nmore than a dozen nations, with the aim of developing an international network\\r\\ntargeting large-scale intellectual property (IP) crimes.  The DOJ has organized\\r\\nthe week-long gathering in Bangkok, Thailand, with the assistance of the\\r\\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the U.S. Patent and Trademark\\r\\nOffice, and the U.S. Department of State.', 'High-level police and customs officials and prosecutors from the United States,\\r\\nChina, Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Philippines,\\r\\nSingapore, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam are participating in the\\r\\nconference, which seeks to enhance cross-border cooperation in the fight against\\r\\nIP theft through the establishment of an Intellectual Property Crimes\\r\\nEnforcement Network (IPCEN).', 'The IPCEN is designed to serve two primary functions.  First, it will operate as\\r\\na forum to exchange successful investigation and prosecution strategies in\\r\\ncombating piracy and counterfeiting crimes.  Second, the IPCEN will strengthen\\r\\ncommunication channels to promote coordinated, multinational prosecutions of the\\r\\nmost serious offenders.  In closed sessions this week, panels of law enforcement\\r\\nexperts will share best practices and lessons learned in addressing retail\\r\\ncounterfeiting and piracy, the mass production and distribution of counterfeit\\r\\ngoods, Internet-based IP theft, and border enforcement.', 'In recognition that effective prosecution of IP crime depends heavily on\\r\\ncooperation between victims and law enforcement authorities, industry\\r\\nrepresentatives will also address the conference regarding the scope and\\r\\nseverity of counterfeiting crimes in Asia, and discuss ways to collectively\\r\\nenhance enforcement efforts.', 'Protecting intellectual property rights in the United States and throughout the\\r\\nworld is one of the highest priorities of the Department of Justice, said\\r\\nActing Attorney General Peter D. Keisler. The development of the Intellectual\\r\\nProperty Crimes Enforcement Network is an important step in coordinating\\r\\nenforcement efforts in a critical region of the world.', 'Counterfeit products not only result in harm to world economies, but also\\r\\nrepresent a serious threat to the health and safety of the people of all\\r\\nnations, said James E. Finch, Assistant Director of the Cyber Division, Federal\\r\\nBureau of Investigation.  We are fully committed to the IPCENs collaborative\\r\\napproach to combating serious intellectual property crimes.', '\"Counterfeiting and piracy exploit borders and customs processes across the\\r\\nglobe, resulting in hundreds of billions of dollars annually entering the dark\\r\\ncrevices of organized criminal syndicates, said Julie L. Myers Assistant\\r\\nSecretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Alliances like IPCEN\\r\\nallow ICE and our international partners to continue to protect our collective\\r\\nborders and pierce the international barriers that shelter these transnational\\r\\ncriminals and their illicit profits.', '\\tThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) actively participates in efforts\\r\\nto improve enforcement of intellectual property rights, and we are proud to be a\\r\\nco-organizer of this important conference of key law enforcement officials from\\r\\naround Asia, said Lois Boland, Director of the Office of Intellectual Property\\r\\nPolicy and Enforcement at the USPTO.', '\\tThe IPCEN initiative reflects the Department of Justices continuing commitment\\r\\nto aggressively protect and enforce IP rights.  The idea for the Conference\\r\\narose from recommendations of the Departments Task Force on Intellectual\\r\\nProperty, which recently conducted a wide-ranging review of the Departments\\r\\nenforcement efforts.  Based upon this review, the Department designated an\\r\\nexperienced federal prosecutor in the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok to serve as its IP\\r\\nLaw Enforcement Coordinator for Asia and coordinate regional efforts to protect\\r\\nintellectual property rights.

Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Donald J. Cazayoux Jr. for the Middle District of Louisiana.   \", ' After a three-week trial, the jury found Wen Chyu Liu, aka David W. Liou, 74, of Houston, guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft and one count of perjury.', \" According to the evidence presented in court, Liou came to the United States from China for graduate work.  He began working for Dow in 1965 and retired in 1992.  Dow is a leading producer of the elastomeric polymer, chlorinated polyethylene (CPE).  Dow's Tyrin CPE is used in a number of applications worldwide, such as automotive and industrial hoses, electrical cable jackets and vinyl siding.  \", \" While employed at Dow, Liou worked as a research scientist at the company's Plaquemine, La., facility on various aspects of the development and manufacture of Dow elastomers, including Tyrin CPE.  Liou had access to trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information pertaining to Dow's Tyrin CPE process and product technology.   The evidence at trial established that Liou conspired with at least four current and former employees of Dow's facilities in Plaquemine and Stade, Germany, who had worked in Tyrin CPE production, to misappropriate those trade secrets in an effort to develop and market CPE process design packages to various Chinese companies.  \\n\\r\\n            Liou traveled extensively throughout China to market the stolen information, and evidence introduced at trial showed that he paid current and former Dow employees for Dow's CPE-related material and information.  In one instance, Liou bribed a then-employee at the Plaquemine facility with $50,000 in cash to provide Dow's process manual and other CPE-related information. \", ' \"Today a federal jury found Mr. Liou guilty of stealing protected trade secrets from Dow Chemical Company, including by bribing fellow employees for this valuable information,\" said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  \"American industries thrive on innovation and they invest substantial resources in developing new products and technology. We will not allow individuals to steal the technology and products that U.S. companies have invested years of time and considerable money to create.\" ', ' \"This office will continue to pursue sophisticated and complex schemes, such as the one perpetrated by this defendant,\" said U.S. Attorney Cazayoux.  \"Such actions undermine the economic viability of our community and our nation, and will not be tolerated.\"\\n\\r\\n  \"Companies within the United States lose millions of dollars to the theft of trade secrets such as this,\" said Special Agent-in-Charge David Welker of the FBI\\'s New Orleans Division. \"The FBI is committed to aggressively identifying and investigating such schemes and along with our partners to bring the perpetrators to justice.\"', ' In addition, according to evidence presented at trial related to the perjury charge, Liou falsely denied during a deposition that he made arrangements for a co-conspirator to travel to China to meet with representatives of a Chinese company interested in designing and building a new CPE plant.  Liou was under oath at the time of the deposition, which was part of a federal civil suit brought by Dow against Liou.', \" Liou faces a maximum of 10 years in prison on the conspiracy to commit trade secrets theft charge, and a maximum of five years in prison on the perjury charge.  Each count also carries a maximum fine of $250,000.  A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled.\\r\\n          \\r\\n            The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Corey R. Amundson, who serves as the Senior Deputy Criminal Chief, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian F. Hipwell for the Middle District of Louisiana, as well as Trial Attorney Kendra Ervin of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.

      "['BOSTON - Eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major U.S. retailers and the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers have been charged with numerous crimes, including conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft, Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Michael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California Karen P. Hewitt, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Benton J. Campbell and U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan announced today. The scheme is believed to constitute the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice. ', \"Three of the defendants are U.S. citizens, one is from Estonia, three are from Ukraine, two are from the People's Republic of China and one is from Belarus. One individual is only known by an alias online, and his place of origin is unknown.\", 'In an indictment returned on Aug. 5, 2008, by a federal grand jury in Boston, Albert \"Segvec\" Gonzalez, of Miami, was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy for his role in the scheme. Criminal informations were also released today in Boston on related charges against Christopher Scott and Damon Patrick Toey, both of Miami. ', 'The Boston indictment alleges that during the course of the sophisticated conspiracy, Gonzalez and his co-conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by \"wardriving\" and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ\\'s Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. Once inside the networks, they installed \"sniffer\" programs that would capture card numbers, as well as password and account information, as they moved through the retailers\\' credit and debit processing networks.', 'The indictment alleges that after they collected the data, the conspirators concealed the data in encrypted computer servers that they controlled in Eastern Europe and the United States. They allegedly sold some of the credit and debit card numbers, via the Internet, to other criminals in the United States and Eastern Europe. The stolen numbers were \"cashed out\" by encoding card numbers on the magnetic strips of blank cards. The defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from ATMs. Gonzalez and others were allegedly able to conceal and launder their fraud proceeds by using anonymous Internet-based currencies both within the United States and abroad, and by channeling funds through bank accounts in Eastern Europe. ', 'Gonzalez was previously arrested by the Secret Service in 2003 for access device fraud. During the course of this investigation, the Secret Service discovered that Gonzalez, who was working as a confidential informant for the agency, was criminally involved in the case. Because of the size and scope of his criminal activity, Gonzalez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if he is convicted of all the charges alleged in the Boston indictment.', 'Also today, indictments were unsealed in San Diego against scheme participant Maksym \"Maksik\" Yastremskiy, of Kharkov, Ukraine, and Aleksandr \"Jonny Hell\" Suvorov, of Sillamae, Estonia. The indictments charge the defendants with crimes related to the sale of the stolen credit card data that Gonzalez and others illegally obtained, as well as additional stolen credit card data. Suvorov is charged with conspiracy to possess unauthorized access devices, possession of unauthorized access devices, trafficking in unauthorized access devices, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and aiding and abetting. Yastremskiy is charged with trafficking in unauthorized access devices, identity theft, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. The indictment also contains a forfeiture allegation. ', 'In addition, an indictment against Hung-Ming Chiu and Zhi Zhi Wang, both of the People\\'s Republic of China, and a person known only by the online nickname \"Delpiero,\" was also unsealed in San Diego today. Chiu, Wang and Delpiero are charged with conspiracy to possess unauthorized access devices, trafficking in unauthorized access devices, trafficking in counterfeit access devices, possession of unauthorized access devices, aggravated identity theft, and aiding and abetting. Also in San Diego, Sergey Pavolvich, of Belarus, and Dzmitry Burak and Sergey Storchak, both of Ukraine, were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to traffic in unauthorized access devices. All are believed to be foreign nationals residing outside of the United States. ', \"The San Diego charges allege that Yastremskiy, Suvorov, Chiu, Wang, Delpiero, Pavolvich, Burak and Storchak operated an international stolen credit and debit card distribution ring with operations from Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, the People's Republic of China, the Philippines and Thailand. The indictments allege that each of the defendants sold stolen credit and debit card information for personal gain. For example, the indictment of Yastremskiy alleges that he received proceeds exceeding $11 million from this criminal activity. These indictments and complaints are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. \", 'In May 2008, Gonzalez, Suvorov and Yastremskiy also were charged in a related indictment in the Eastern District of New York. The New York charges allege that the trio was engaged in a sophisticated scheme to hack into computer networks run by the Dave & Buster\\'s restaurant chain, and stole credit and debit card numbers from at least 11 locations. Specifically, the indictment alleges that the defendants gained unauthorized access to the cash register terminals and installed at each restaurant a \"packet sniffer,\" a computer code designed to capture communications on a computer network. The packet sniffer was configured to capture credit and debit card numbers as this information was processed by the restaurants. At one restaurant location, the packet sniffer captured data for approximately 5,000 credit and debit cards, eventually causing losses of at least $600,000 to the financial institutions that issued the credit and debit cards.', 'Gonzalez is currently in pre-trial confinement on the New York charges. Based upon the San Diego charges, Turkish officials apprehended Yastremskiy in July 2007 in Turkey when he travelled there on vacation. He has been in confinement since then in Turkey, pending the resolution of related Turkish charges, and the United States has made a formal request for his extradition. At the request of the Department of Justice, Suvorov was apprehended by the German Federal Police in Frankfurt in March 2008 on the San Diego charges when he travelled there on vacation. He is currently in confinement pending the resolution of extradition proceedings.', '\"So far as we know, this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country,\" said Attorney General Mukasey. \"It highlights the efforts of the Justice Department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that, with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world, we can identify, charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers.\"', '\"While technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities.  This case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results.  Consumers, companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those, whether here or abroad, that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain,\" said U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan.', '\"These prosecutions demonstrate that, through coordinated commitment, the United States Secret Service and the Department of Justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations, wherever based and however sophisticated. The United States Attorney\\'s Office for the Southern District of California is especially gratified that the work of the San Diego field office of the Secret Service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise,\" said Karen P. Hewitt, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California.', '\"Computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial, personal and financial security,\" said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Benton J. Campbell. \"Hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of U.S. criminal justice.\"', '\"Technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted, virtually erasing geographic boundaries,\" said U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan. \"While these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations, this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside.\"', '\"The Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes,\" said Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Chief Eileen Mayer. \"Today\\'s indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts.  We are committed to the government\\'s efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity.\"  ', \"These cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann of the District of Massachusetts, Assistant U.S. Attorney Orlando Gutierrez of the Southern District of California, Assistant U.S. Attorney Will Campos of the Eastern District of New York, and by Senior Counsel Kimberly Kiefer Peretti, and Trial Attorneys Jenny Ellickson and Evan Williams of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime & Intellectual Property Section. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs provided extensive assistance related to extradition matters. All of theses cases are being investigated by the U.S. Secret Service. The IRS-CI provided significant investigatory assistance in the Boston case.\", '###', '08-689']\n",

Wainstein,\\r\\nAssistant Attorney General for National Security; Julie L. Myers, Homeland\\r\\nSecurity Assistant Secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE);\\r\\nTimothy D. Bereznay, Assistant Director, FBI Counterintelligence Division;\\r\\nDarryl W. Jackson, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement;\\r\\nCharles W. Beardall, Director of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service\\r\\n(DCIS); and Stephen D. Mull, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political\\r\\nMilitary Affairs.', 'The threat posed by illegal foreign acquisition of restricted U.S. technology is\\r\\nsubstantial and growing. In the past week, there have been federal cases\\r\\ninvolving the illegal export of items with nuclear and missile applications to\\r\\nPakistan and the illegal export of U.S. fighter jet components sought by Iran. A\\r\\n2006 Defense Department report noted a 43 percent increase in the number of\\r\\nsuspicious foreign contacts with U.S. defense firms, and an Intelligence\\r\\nCommunity report issued last year asserted that entities from a record 108\\r\\nnations were engaged in efforts to obtain controlled U.S. technology.', 'China and Iran pose particular U.S. export control concerns. The majority of\\r\\nU.S. criminal export prosecutions in recent years have involved restricted U.S.\\r\\ntechnology bound for these nations as opposed to others. Recent prosecutions\\r\\nhave highlighted illegal exports of stealth missile technology, military\\r\\naircraft components, Naval warship data, night vision equipment, and other\\r\\nrestricted technology destined for China or Iran.', 'Foreign states and terrorist organizations are actively seeking to acquire U.S.\\r\\ndata, technological knowledge and equipment that will advance their military\\r\\ncapacity, their weapons systems and even their weapons of mass destruction\\r\\nprograms. Many have targeted our government, industries and universities as\\r\\nsources of these materials, said Assistant Attorney General Wainstein. This\\r\\ninitiative is a coordinated campaign to keep sensitive U.S. technology from\\r\\nfalling into the wrong hands and from being used against our allies, against our\\r\\ntroops overseas or against Americans at home.', 'New Counter-Proliferation Task Forces and Training', '\\tA critical part of this new initiative will be the formation of\\r\\nCounter-Proliferation Task Forces in appropriate U.S. Attorneys offices around\\r\\nthe country. These multi-agency task forces will take many of the concepts used\\r\\nin combating terrorism  namely, prevention, cooperation and coordination -- and\\r\\napply them to the counter-proliferation effort. The task forces will be designed\\r\\nto enhance cooperation among all agencies involved in export control, forge\\r\\nrelationships with affected industries, and facilitate information sharing to\\r\\nprevent illegal foreign acquisition of U.S. technology.', 'The Departments National Security Division is in discussions with districts\\r\\nwith large concentrations of high-tech businesses and research facilities -- all\\r\\nof which are potential targets for illegal foreign acquisition efforts -- as\\r\\npotential venues for new task forces.  Some task forces may be modeled after\\r\\nefforts that exist in the Southern District of New York, District of Connecticut\\r\\nand District of Maryland, where agents from ICE, FBI, Commerce Department, DCIS\\r\\nand other agencies pool data and coordinate cases. Other approaches may be taken\\r\\nin different districts, depending on the needs of the U.S. Attorney and agencies\\r\\nin that district.', '\\tThe new initiative also includes key training components. Export prosecutions\\r\\nare by nature complex because they involve intricate laws, sensitive\\r\\ninternational issues, agencies with different authorities, and, often,\\r\\nclassified information. Under the initiative, the Department will provide\\r\\nspecialized training to its field prosecutors, especially those with limited\\r\\nexpertise in export control.  The Department launched this enhanced training\\r\\neffort in May with a national conference in South Carolina.', 'The Justice Department has also appointed its first National Export Control\\r\\nCoordinator to implement this initiative and foster coordination among the\\r\\nagencies involved in export control. Based in the Counterespionage Section of\\r\\nthe National Security Division, the Coordinator is responsible for managing the\\r\\nnationwide training of prosecutors and monitoring progress on export control\\r\\nprosecutions around the country.', 'Improved Coordination With Export Licensing Agencies', 'A final component of the initiative involves greater coordination between the\\r\\nJustice Department and the export licensing agencies, particularly the State\\r\\nDepartments Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Commerce Departments\\r\\nBureau of Industry and Security. As part of the initiative, the Justice\\r\\nDepartments National Security Division has initiated monthly meetings with the\\r\\nleadership of these offices to ensure that investigations, prosecutions and\\r\\nenforcement issues are fully coordinated.', 'These crimes result in some of the most complex and time-consuming cases facing\\r\\nfederal law enforcement, said Julie L. Myers, Homeland Security Assistant\\r\\nSecretary for ICE.  The concept of terrorists, criminals or rogue nations\\r\\nobtaining weapons and other restricted technology is chilling.  By harnessing\\r\\nour collective authorities and efforts, we are better able to protect our\\r\\nnational security and global public safety.', 'According to Timothy D. Bereznay, Assistant Director, FBI Counterintelligence\\r\\nDivision, The FBI is committed to working with our law enforcement and\\r\\nintelligence partners in the aggressive pursuit and investigation of high\\r\\ntechnology export violations.  The theft of intellectual property and technology\\r\\nby foreign parties or governments directly threatens both the national and\\r\\neconomic security of the U.S. in which the development and manufacturing of U.S.\\r\\nproducts results in weakened economic capability and diminished political\\r\\nstature for this country. ', \"I commend Assistant Attorney General Wainstein and the Department of Justice\\r\\nfor their leadership on the Export Enforcement Initiative, said Commerce\\r\\nAssistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Darryl W. Jackson. This initiative\\r\\nenhances the administration's counter-proliferation program by vigorously\\r\\npursuing and prosecuting individuals who violate our laws and allow U.S.\\r\\ntechnology to fall into the wrong hands.\", \"There are few greater threats to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines\\r\\nthan confronting highly-advanced weapons and technology which were designed to\\r\\nprotect them and to give them the advantage on the battlefield.  It is clear\\r\\nthen why the Defense Criminal Investigative Service has for years made illegal\\r\\ntechnology export a top investigative priority.  Our agents, who are dedicated\\r\\nto protecting America's Warfighters, need no motivation in aggressively pursuing\\r\\nthese criminals. This initiative is vital and has our full support, said DCIS\\r\\nDirector Charles W. Beardall.\", 'As head of the U.S. Government agency responsible for controlling the export of\\r\\nU.S. defense articles and services, I am delighted to lend my full support to\\r\\nthe Export Enforcement Initiative.  The Department of State has always\\r\\nmaintained a close, working relationship with the federal law enforcement\\r\\ncommunity in its investigation and prosecution of criminal violations of our\\r\\nnations export control laws.  We expect that relationship to only become\\r\\nstronger under this initiative to keep sensitive defense items out of the wrong\\r\\nhands, said Acting Assistant Secretary of State Stephen D. Mull.', 'Foreign Efforts to Obtain Controlled U.S. Technology', 'The technology at the heart of this initiative includes restricted U.S. military\\r\\nitems, dual-use equipment, and other technical expertise or know-how, some of\\r\\nwhich have applications in Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). These materials\\r\\nare generally restricted and may not be exported without U.S. government\\r\\napproval. Foreign procurement networks intent on obtaining such materials from\\r\\nthe U.S. rarely target complete weapons systems, but often focus on seemingly\\r\\ninnocuous components to develop their own weapons systems. Two cases in the past\\r\\nweek are exemplary:', 'Nuclear-Related Technology to Pakistan: On Oct. 4, 2007, a Pittsburgh company\\r\\ncalled SparesGlobal, Inc. was sentenced in the Western District of Pennsylvania\\r\\nfor conspiring to make false statements about an illegal export of graphite\\r\\nproducts that can be used in nuclear reactors and in the nose cones of ballistic\\r\\nmissiles. These sensitive products ended up in Pakistan after being routed\\r\\nthrough the United Arab Emirates. The investigation was conducted by Commerce\\r\\nDepartment agents.', 'Illegal Exports of U.S. Fighter Jet Components: On Oct. 5, 2007, Abraham\\r\\nTrujillo and David Wayne were charged in the District of Utah with attempting to\\r\\nillegally export restricted components for F-4 and F-14 fighter jets. Such\\r\\nexports are of particular concern because F-14 components are widely sought by\\r\\nIran, which is currently the only government in the world that still flies the\\r\\nF-14 fighter jet. The investigation was conducted by ICE and DCIS agents.', '\\tAccording to the Intelligence Communitys most recent report to Congress on\\r\\nForeign Economic Espionage and Industrial Collection, private-sector\\r\\nbusinessmen, scientists, students, and academics from overseas are among the\\r\\nmost active collectors of sensitive U.S. technology.  Most did not initially\\r\\ncome to the U.S. with that intent, nor were they directed to do so by foreign\\r\\ngovernments. Instead, after finding that they had access to technology in demand\\r\\noverseas, they engaged in illegal collection to satisfy a desire for profits,\\r\\nacclaim, or patriotism to their home nations.', 'At the same time, foreign government organizations remain aggressive in\\r\\nillegally acquiring sensitive U.S. technology. Some governments have established\\r\\nquasi-official organizations in the U.S. to facilitate contact with overseas\\r\\nscientists, engineers and businessmen. Foreign governments have been observed\\r\\ndirectly targeting U.S. firms; employing commercial firms in the U.S. and third\\r\\ncountries to acquire U.S. technology; and recruiting students, professors, and\\r\\nscientists to engage in technology collection.', 'Enhanced U.S. Law Enforcement Response', 'In addressing such threats, law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors\\r\\nhave stepped their enforcement activity in recent years. ICE has recently\\r\\ndoubled the number of agents assigned to export control cases and reports making\\r\\n149 export-related arrests last fiscal year. The FBI reports that it is\\r\\ninvestigating roughly 125 economic espionage cases and has increased\\r\\ncounterintelligence instruction for new agents by 240 percent.', 'The Commerce Department reports that more than 80 percent of its export\\r\\nconvictions in fiscal year 2007 were related to WMD proliferation, terrorist\\r\\nsupport or diversion to military end-use. DCIS and other Defense Department\\r\\nagencies have also stepped up their investigative efforts to protect critical\\r\\nmilitary technologies. As a result, the Justice Department has seen a\\r\\ncorresponding surge in export prosecutions. In fiscal year 2007, there was more\\r\\nthan a 50 percent increase in defendants charged with violating the primary\\r\\nexport control statutes compared to the prior year.', '###', '07-806']\n",

', \"The sentence, the first handed down for a violation of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 USC Section 1831), was announced by Patrick Rowan, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security; Joseph P. Russoniello, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California; Arthur Cummings, Executive Assistant Director for the FBI's National Security Branch; and Julie L. Myers, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\", \"On August 1, 2007, Meng pleaded guilty to two national security violations: one count of violating the Economic Espionage Act and one count of violating the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Meng's conviction was the first involving military source code under the Arms Export Control Act and marked the second case in which there was a conviction under the Economic Espionage Act for misappropriating a trade secret with the intent to benefit a foreign government. \", 'According to court records, Meng committed economic espionage by misappropriating a trade secret, known as \"Mantis 1.5.5,\" from his former employer, Quantum3D Inc., with the intent to benefit a foreign government, specifically the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC) Navy Research Center in Beijing. He did so by using the Mantis 1.5.5 trade secret as part of a demonstration project in attempting to sell products of his new employer, Orad, Hi-Tec Systems Ltd., which was a direct competitor of Quantum3D. The trade secret at issue, known as \"Mantis,\" is a Quantum3D product used to simulate real world motion for military training and other purposes. ', 'In addition, Meng violated the Arms Export Control Act by knowingly and willfully exporting to the PRC a defense article on the United States Munitions List (defense article viXsen) without authorization from the United States.

', 'According to court documents, the investigation established that Meng had, in fact, misappropriated two defense articles (specifically nVSensor, in addition to viXsen described above), at least six source code products which were also trade secrets, and more than one hundred materials and utilities belonging to his former employer, Quantum3D. Many of these misappropriated Quantum3D products were intended primarily for military purposes. For example, nVSensor is a Quantum3D product used to provide night vision simulation and is exclusively used in military applications for precision training and simulation applications.

Source code for military visual simulation programs to train military fighter pilots and restricted defense articles were also willfully exported outside the United States.  We will continue to enforce the criminal laws against those who violate export restrictions and misappropriate our trade secrets.  Many of the systems we protect are designed to safeguard our men and women in harm\\'s way and compromising them significantly adds to the perils that they face in defending us.

Myers, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for ICE. \"The export of U.S. military products and sensitive technology is controlled for good reason - in the wrong hands, these items could be used to harm America or its allies. Enforcing U.S. export laws is one of ICE\\'s top priorities, and we will continue to work with our partners in law enforcement and industry to ensure that those who put our country at risk are brought to justice.\"', 'FBI Executive Assistant Director for the National Security Branch, Arthur Cummings stated, \"Protecting our nation\\'s most sensitive trade secrets and critical technology is at the core of the FBI mission.

Disclosure of this information to outside entities like the PRC\\r\\nwould compromise our national security.', '\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe case against Chung is related to an investigation into another engineer\\r\\nwho worked in the United States and obtained sensitive military information for\\r\\nthe PRC. The man, Chi Mak, and several of his family members were convicted last\\r\\nyear of providing defense articles to the PRC (see: www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2007/074.html).\\r\\nMak is scheduled to be sentenced on March 24.', '\\tAccording to the indictment that was unsealed this morning, individuals in the\\r\\nChinese aviation industry began sending Chung tasking letters as early as\\r\\n1979. Over the years, the letters directed Chung to collect specific\\r\\ntechnological information, including data related to the Space Shuttle and\\r\\nvarious military and civilian aircraft. Chung allegedly responded in one letter\\r\\nindicating a desire to contribute to the motherland.', 'In various letters to his handlers in the PRC, Chung referenced engineering\\r\\nmanuals he had collected and sent to the PRC, including 24 manuals relating to\\r\\nthe B-1 Bomber that Rockwell had prohibited from disclosure outside of the\\r\\ncompany. According to the indictment, between 1985 and 2003, Chung made multiple\\r\\ntrips to the PRC to deliver lectures on technology involving the Space Shuttle\\r\\nand other programs, and during those trips he met with officials and agents of\\r\\nthe PRC government. The indictment alleges that Chung and PRC officials\\r\\nexchanged letters that discussed cover stories for Chungs travel to China and\\r\\nrecommended methods for passing information, including suggestions that Chung\\r\\nuse Chi Mak to transmit information.', '\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indictment describes a May 2, 1987 letter from Gu Weihao, an official in\\r\\nthe Ministry of Aviation and China Aviation Industry Corporation, which\\r\\ndiscussed the possibility of inviting Chungs wife, who is an artist, to visit\\r\\nan art institute so that Chung could use the cover of traveling with his wife as\\r\\nan excuse to travel to the PRC. This same letter suggested that passing\\r\\ninformation to the PRC through Chi Mak would be faster and safer and concluded\\r\\nwith the statement: It is your honor and Chinas fortune that you are able to\\r\\nrealize your wish of dedicating yourself to the service of your country. The\\r\\nindictment describes a second letter from Gu Weihao, dated April 12, 1988, which\\r\\nasked Chung to provide information on advanced technologies. This letter\\r\\nstated that Rebecca Mak was in the PRC and she had reported that Chung and the\\r\\nMaks had a good relationship.', 'The FBI is committed to protecting America\\'s assets from foreign thievery,\"\\r\\nsaid Salvador Hernandez, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\\'s Los Angeles\\r\\nField Office. \"The arrest and indictment of Mr. Chung should serve as a reminder\\r\\nto those who would compromise the economic and physical security of the United\\r\\nStates by stealing proprietary information. The FBI will continue to work with\\r\\nNASA, the defense community and other federal agencies to safeguard our nation\\'s\\r\\ntechnology.', '\\tEach charge of economic espionage carries a maximum possible penalty of 15\\r\\nyears in prison and a $500,000 fine. The charges of acting as an agent of a\\r\\nforeign government without prior notification to the Attorney General and\\r\\nobstruction of justice each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and\\r\\na $250,000 fine. The charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage and\\r\\nmaking a false statement to federal investigators each carry a maximum possible\\r\\npenalty of five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.', '\\r\\n\\r\\nAn indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. \\r\\nEvery defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a\\r\\nreasonable doubt', '\\tThe investigation in this case was conducted jointly by the FBI and NASA\\r\\nCounterintelligence.

      "['KANSAS CITY, Mo. a David M. Ketchmark, Acting United States Attorney for the Western  District of Missouri, announced two Chinese nationals were charged in federal  court today with attempting to pay $100,000 for stolen trade secrets from  Pittsburgh Corning Corporation, which has a manufacturing plant in Sedalia, Mo.,  that produces FOAMGLASA(r) insulation.', 'Ji Li  Huang, 45, and Xiao Guang Qi, 31, both citizens of China, were charged in a  federal criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Mo.  Todayas complaint alleges that Huang and Qi attempted to illegally purchase  trade secrets of Pittsburgh Corning for the purpose of opening a plant in China  to compete with Pittsburgh Corning. Huang and Qi, who were arrested on Sunday,  Sept. 2, 2012, had an initial court appearance today and remain in federal  custody pending a detention hearing.', 'Pittsburgh  Corning, headquartered in Pittsburgh, Penn., manufactures various grades or  densities of cellular glass insulation sold under the trade name FOAMGLASA(r).  That material is used to insulate buildings, industrial piping systems and  liquefied natural gas storage tank bases. Pittsburgh Corningas customers include  energy companies, petro chemical companies, and natural gas facilities.', 'The  Pittsburgh Corning facility in Sedalia is the companyas flagship facility in  the United States, responsible for the majority of the material produced by the  company. The Sedalia facility operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The  plant employs approximately 200 people and conducts research and development on  FOAMGLASA(r) for Pittsburgh Corning.', 'Pittsburgh  Corning recently made technological advances in the formulation and  manufacturing process of FOAMGLASA(r) insulation. Pittsburgh Corning considers the  product formula and manufacturing process for FOAMGLASA(r) proprietary and trade  secrets.', 'Three  months ago, Pittsburgh Corning announced that it is planning to open a facility  in China to satisfy the growing building and industrial markets in China.', 'According  to an affidavit filed in support of todayas criminal complaint, a man  identified as aT.S.a requested a tour of Pittsburgh Corningas FOAMGLASA(r) plant  on June 7, 2012. Pittsburgh Corning refused the request for a tour. On June 14,  2012, T.S., along with Huang and an uncharged co-conspirator (who is not  identified in the affidavit), met with a plant employee. The plant employee  discussed some of the general process of producing FOAMGLASA(r), however, he did  not disclose any proprietary information.', 'Another  plant employee reported that Huang and the uncharged co-conspirator were trespassing  at the Sedalia plant on June 18 and 19, 2012. They allegedly recorded video or  photos on a cell phone and asked employees specific questions about FOAMGLASA(r).', 'On July  22, 2012, an advertisement was published in the local newspaper that solicited  atechnical talenta with experience at Corning Pittsburgh to lead a project to  build a foam glass factory in the Asian market. A confidential source a working  with the FBI a responded to the contact e-mail address cited in the newspaper advertisement.  A second uncharged co-conspirator (who also is not identified in the affidavit)  allegedly corresponded by e-mail with the FBIas cooperating source, who pretended  to be willing to unlawfully copy and sell trade secrets. During a monitored telephone  call, the affidavit says, the cooperating source told this co-conspirator that the  information he requested was Pittsburgh Corningas proprietary and confidential  information and that he could go to jail, if anyone found out he gave away  Pittsburgh Corningas proprietary information.', 'During  the monitored telephone call, the affidavit says, this co-conspirator agreed to  pay $100,000 to the cooperating source. They later arranged for Huang to travel  from China to the United States to meet with the cooperating source. They  allegedly agreed that $25,000 would be exchanged on Sept. 2, 2012, for a  package of Pittsburgh Corningas processes and formulary on FOAMGLASA(r). They also  discussed paying the cooperating source to travel to China several times for  consulting, the affidavit says.', 'On  Saturday, Sept. 1, 2012, the cooperating source met with Huang and Qi at a  Kansas City restaurant. Qi participated in the meeting and also acted as a  translator for Huang for parts of the conversation. According to the affidavit,  a follow-up meeting was scheduled for the next day, at which the cooperating  source would bring the stolen proprietary information and Huang and Qi would  bring the payment. The cooperating source told Huang and Qi that he had to  drive back to Pittsburgh Corning and break into the engineering department to  steal the documents and drawings for the equipment in order to complete the  list. Qi asked if there would be any problem; the cooperating source explained  to Qi there would be no problem because nobody would be at the plant over the  holiday weekend.', 'The next  day, the affidavit says, Huang and Qi met the cooperating source at a  prearranged location and brought a bag containing the money. The cooperating  source showed them documents that were purportedly Pittsburgh Corningas trade  secret information, some of which were stamped with secret and confidential  markings.', 'Shortly  afterward, FBI agents arrested Huang and Qi at their hotel room.', 'Ketchmark  cautioned that the charge contained in this complaint is simply an accusation,  and not evidence of guilt. Evidence supporting the charge must be presented to  a federal trial jury, whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence.', 'Download Court Documents ', 'Return to Top']\n",

      "['SALT LAKE CITY a Two individuals and two companies are charged with theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the alleged theft of trade secrets from Orbit Irrigation Products, Inc., a sprinkler and irrigation company headquartered in Utah, in an indictment unsealed Monday.', '            Charged in the indictment are Janice Kuang Capener, age 32, and Luo Jun, age 36, citizens of the Peopleas Republic of China; Sunhills International, LLC, a California company established by Capener; and Zhejiang Hongchen Irrigation Equipment Co., LTD, a Chinese manufacturer of irrigation equipment that had a contractual relationship with Orbit to manufacture some of its products. The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in Salt Lake City in late April.', '            Capener, who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States, was employed by Orbit Irrigation Products from about June 16, 2003, until about November 1, 2009. From about March 14, 2005, until about May 13, 2009, Capener was in charge of operations at an Orbit manufacturing plant in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China. She was notified of her termination in May 2009 and worked as a paid consultant for the company until her termination was finalized in November of that year.', '            Luo Jun was the chief executive officer and owner of Zhejiang Hongchen Irrigation Equipment Co., LTD.\\r\\n            The first five counts of the indictment charge Capener with theft of trade secrets. The indictment alleges that she took information related to customers and the pricing and sales of sprinkler and irrigation products without authorization from secure Orbit databases and used that information for herself and others to the economic detriment of Orbit.', '            The sixth count of the indictment charges Capener, Luo Jun, Sunhills International and Zhejiang Hongchen Irrigation Equipment with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The indictment alleges the defendants devised a scheme to begin undermining Orbitas position in the marketplace using illegally obtained proprietary pricing information.', 'As a part of the alleged scheme, the defendants used Sunhills International to market and distribute products. Luo Junas company, Hongchen, would afloata or provide upfront free irrigation and sprinkler products to Sunhills to market to U.S. retailers, the indictment alleges. The defendants also, according to the indictment, took other steps to begin undermining Orbitas position in the marketplace, including an anonymous complaint to Wal-Mart about conditions at Orbitas factory in Ningbo, and, despite their agreements to the contrary, Hongchen increased the manufacturing costs for the products it was manufacturing for Orbit.', '            The indictment alleges the defendants used manufacturing, cost, customer, and pricing information in contravention of confidentiality agreements with Orbit to begin pricing Orbit out of the market. The indictment references e-mails between defendants and others establishing business relationships in furtherance of the scheme; sharing proprietary cost, customer, and pricing information of Orbit; and arranging to undercut Orbitas prices by marketing products to Orbit customers at lower prices than Orbitas.', '            The final 12 counts of the indictment charge Capener, Luo Jun and the two companies with wire fraud in connection with the scheme.', '            The case is being investigated by the FBI Salt Lake Field Office and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys in Salt Lake City. The Office of International Affairs in the Justice Departmentas Criminal Division also provided assistance.', '            Capener and Luo Jun were arrested in Las Vegas Friday morning. They had initial appearances Friday in federal court in Las Vegas. Luo Jun was detained and is scheduled for an identity hearing late Monday afternoon in Las Vegas. Capener was released following her appearance in Las Vegas. She appeared for an arraignment Monday afternoon in Salt Lake City. She entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. She will continue on her pre-trial release status which includes GPS monitoring and a curfew.', '            Each charge of theft of trade secrets carries a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000. The conspiracy to commit wire fraud count and each count of wire fraud carry maximum sentences of 30 years and fines of $1 million.', '            Indictments are allegations and are not findings of guilt. Individuals and businesses charged in indictments are presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty in court.\\n', 'Return to Top']\n",

      "['\\r\\nWASHINGTON -- A multi-agency initiative to combat illegal exports of restricted military and dual-use technology from the United States has resulted in criminal charges against more than 145 defendants in the past fiscal year, with roughly 43 percent of these cases involving munitions or other restricted technology bound for Iran or China, the Justice Department and several partner agencies announced today.', '\\r\\nOver the past fiscal year, the National Export Enforcement Initiative has also resulted in the creation of Counter-Proliferation Task Forces in various judicial districts around the country. Today, there are approximately 15 such task forces or versions of them nationwide. In addition, the initiative has resulted in enhanced training for more than 500 agents and prosecutors involved in export control and the creation of new mechanisms to enhance counter-proliferation coordination among law enforcement agencies, export licensing agencies and the Intelligence Community.', \"\\r\\nAmong the most recent cases brought in connection with the initiative was an indictment returned today in the District of Minnesota charging three individuals, Jian Wei Ding, Kok Tong Lim, and Ping Cheng, with conspiring to illegally export to the People's Republic of China (PRC) controlled carbon-fiber material with applications in rockets, satellites, spacecraft, and uranium enrichment process. According to the indictment, the intended destination for some of the material was the China Academy of Space Technology, which oversees research institutes working on spacecraft systems for the PRC.\", \"\\r\\nUnveiled in Oct. 2007, the National Export Enforcement Initiative is a cooperative effort by the Justice Department's National Security Division (NSD), the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and other agencies.\", '\\nThe Threat from Illegal Exports', '\\r\\nOn a daily basis, foreign states as well as criminal and terrorist groups seek arms, technology, and other materials to advance their technological capacity, weapons systems and, in some cases, Weapons of Mass Destruction programs. With America producing the most advanced technology in the world, it has become a primary target of these illicit technology acquisition efforts. The U.S. government, defense sector, private companies, and research institutions are routinely targeted as sources of these materials.', \"\\r\\nThe items sought from America in these illicit schemes are as diverse as missile technology, nuclear technology, assault weapons, trade secrets, source code, military aircraft parts, night vision systems, and technical know-how. The improper transfer of these items poses threats to U.S. allies, U.S. troops overseas, and to Americans at home. It also undermines America's strategic, economic, and military position in the world.\", '\\r\\n\"Keeping U.S. weapons technology and other restricted materials from falling into the wrong hands and from being used against our allies, our troops overseas or Americans at home is a top counter-intelligence priority of the Justice Department,\" said Patrick Rowan, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \"Through this multi-agency initiative we are making America a far more hostile target for those that seek to obtain our sensitive technology through illegal means.\"', '\\nEnhanced Prosecutions and Investigations', '\\r\\nIn recent years, as investigative agencies have stepped up their efforts to address this threat, the Justice Department has handled a growing number of cases involving illegal exports of sensitive U.S. technology and embargo violations. Last year, the Department decided to institutionalize the expansion of its export control efforts through the launch of the National Export Enforcement Initiative, which is designed to increase training and coordination among agencies involved in export control, enhance prosecution of these crimes, and deter illicit activity.', '\\r\\nTo implement the initiative, the Justice Department appointed its first National Export Control Coordinator in June 2007. In October 2007, the Department joined forces with counterparts from ICE, FBI, BIS, DCIS, the Department of State and other agencies to publicly announce the initiative. Since that time, the number of prosecutions has continued to grow, as investigative agencies have increased the tempo of their operations and prosecutors have become more familiar with this area of law.', '\\r\\nDuring Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, there were more than 145 defendants charged in export control or embargo cases, compared to roughly 110 charged in FY 2007. There have been more than 255 defendants charged in such cases over the past two fiscal years. Charges brought in these cases include violations of the Arms Export Control Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the export control provision of the PATRIOT Reauthorization Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act, and other statutes.', '\\nRestricted Materials Bound for Iran and China', '\\r\\nRoughly 43 percent of the defendants charged in FY 2008 were charged in export control or embargo cases involving Iran or China. In total, Iran ranked as the leading destination for illegal exports of restricted U.S. technology in the prosecutions brought in FY 2008, as well as those in FY 2007.', '\\r\\nThe illegal exports bound for Iran have involved such items as missile guidance systems, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) components, military aircraft parts, night vision systems and other materials. The illegal exports to China have involved rocket launch data, Space Shuttle technology, missile technology, naval warship data, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or \"drone\" technology, thermal imaging systems, military night vision systems and other materials.', '\\r\\nA significant portion of the cases in FY 2008 and in FY 2007 also involved illegal exports to Mexico. These prosecutions primarily involved illegal exports of firearms, including assault weapons and rifles, as well as large quantities of ammunition destined for Mexico. In addition, there were several cases during this period involving arms and other materials being routed to terrorist organizations in various nations.', '\\nNew Counter-Proliferation Task Forces', \"\\r\\nThe cornerstone of the initiative has been the ongoing formation of multi-agency Counter-Proliferation Task Forces in U.S. Attorney's offices around the country. Today, there are approximately 15 such task forces or working groups operating nationwide, some straddling more than one judicial district.\", '\\r\\nThese entities have built on prior inter-agency efforts used in certain districts where agents from ICE, FBI, BIS, and Defense Department agencies pool data and jointly pursue cases. Under the leadership of U.S. Attorneys, these task forces foster coordination critical to the success of export control.', '\\nEnhanced Training and Coordination', '\\r\\nBecause export control cases involve complex statutory and regulatory schemes, sophisticated technology, international issues, agencies with different authorities, and, often classified information, training for prosecutors and agents has been a critical focus of the initiative.', \"\\r\\nSince January 2008 alone, the Justice Department's National Security Division has presented more than 30 legal training sessions and lectures around the country on export control. In addition, the Department has held two national export control training conferences and is scheduled to hold another in early 2009 in South Carolina. To date, more than 500 prosecutors and investigators have received training through these mechanisms.\", \"\\r\\nThe Department's National Security Division has also distributed a comprehensive tool kit of legal pleadings and related information on export control for field prosecutors and agents. On a daily basis, the National Export Control Coordinator provides legal advice and counsel for prosecutors and agents on these cases.\", '\\r\\nAnother critical component of the initiative involves enhanced coordination within the export control community. The Justice Department, along with other agencies, has created the Technology Protection Enforcement Group (TPEG), an inter-agency Headquarters-level working group, to enhance export control coordination among law enforcement agencies and between law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community. In addition, the Department has created a working group of intelligence analysts to assist field prosecutors across the country in export cases and to ensure appropriate information sharing with the Intelligence Community.', \"\\r\\nThe Department has also initiated monthly coordination meetings with the export licensing agencies, particularly the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Commerce Department's BIS, to improve coordination and the flow of information to those agencies in accomplishing their missions. Furthermore, the Department regularly participates in and contributes to outreach efforts with foreign governments on export control matters, in conjunction with the State Department.\", '\\nNew Legislation', '\\r\\nOver the past year, the Department has also been involved in a variety of legislative, regulatory, and policy proposals related to export control and embargos. During 2007, for instance, Congress passed and the President signed into law amendments to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which, among other things, added conspiracy and attempt provisions to the IEEPA as well as enhanced criminal fines and administrative fines for violations of this law, which is a critical export and embargo enforcement statute.', '\\r\\n\"We will not allow the United States\\' national security to be held hostage by rogue nations or sold to the highest bidder.  This includes sensitive military information and technology, as well as weapons of mass destruction or the components needed to produce them.  ICE is committed to working closely and cooperatively with our partners at every level of law enforcement to ensure this does not happen.\" Julie L. Myers, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for ICE said.  \"Time after time, our export enforcement investigations have helped prevent the illegal acquisition of these resources and helped maintain military, political and economic stability throughout the world.\" ', '\\r\\n\"No one agency can accomplish the immense task of safeguarding U.S. national security assets and protecting the illegal export of restricted materials, including military and dual-use technologies,\" said Executive Assistant Director Arthur M. Cummings, II, of the FBI\\'s National Security Branch. \"The FBI is committed to enforcing export control laws and will continue to work closely with our partners in the law enforcement and the intelligence communities to enhance export control awareness and training and to build on the success of our Counter-Proliferation Task Forces.\"', '\\r\\n\"We are continuing to sharpen our enforcement efforts to focus on those areas of greatest concern to us: proliferators, supporters of terrorism, and nations of illicit trans-shipment concern. When foreign companies take controlled U.S. technology and illegally transfer it - they also face serious repercussions. We remain committed to investigate, uncover, and stop these activities wherever they may occur,\" said Under Secretary of Commerce Mario Mancuso.', '\\r\\n\"Preventing the illegal export of critical technologies and restricted munitions is of extreme concern to the Department of Defense because of the real possibility that our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines may have to face this materiel in the hands of our adversaries and thereby lose the advantage that U.S. technology is supposed to provide them,\" said Charles W. Beardall, Department of Defense Deputy Inspector General for Investigations. \"Protecting America\\'s Warfighters through technology protection is a top priority for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the law enforcement arm of the DoD Inspector General, and a fundamental focus for our special agents.\"', '\\r\\n\"We applaud the Department of Justice\\'s efforts,\" said John Rood, Acting Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. \"We are pleased that the Department of State has been able to support this important initiative and proud of the tremendous success achieved so far in disrupting the flow of sensitive technology to our adversaries and protecting our national security and foreign policy interests.\"', '\\nForeign Efforts to Obtain Controlled U.S. Technology', '\\r\\nThe technology at the heart of this initiative includes restricted U.S. military items, dual-use equipment, and other technical expertise or know-how, some of which have applications in Weapons of Mass Destruction. These materials are generally restricted and may not be exported without U.S. government approval. Foreign procurement networks intent on obtaining such materials from the U.S. rarely target complete weapons systems, but often focus on seemingly innocuous components to develop their own weapons systems.', '\\r\\nAccording to recent reports by the Intelligence Community, private-sector businessmen, scientists, students, and academics from overseas are among the most active collectors of sensitive U.S. technology. Most did not initially come to the U.S. with that intent, nor were they directed to do so by foreign governments. Instead, after finding that they had access to technology in demand overseas, they engaged in illegal collection to satisfy a desire for profits, acclaim, or patriotism to their home nations.', '\\r\\nAt the same time, foreign government organizations remain aggressive in illegally acquiring sensitive U.S. technology. Some governments have established quasi-official organizations in the U.S. to facilitate contact with overseas scientists, engineers and businessmen. Foreign governments have been observed directly targeting U.S. firms; employing commercial firms in the U.S. and third countries to acquire U.S. technology; and recruiting students, professors, and scientists to engage in technology collection.', '\\nFact Sheet', '###', '08-958']\n",

      "['Joseph Debose, a resident of North Carolina and a former Staff Sergeant in a U.S. Special Forces National Guard Unit, pled guilty today in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York before the Honorable Eric N. Vitaliano to violating the Arms Export Control Act.  According to court documents, Debose provided multiple shipments of firearms to co-conspirators who then secreted the weapons in packages and transported them to shipping companies to be sent to customers in China.  The weapons included numerous semiautomatic handguns, rifles and shotguns.  When sentenced, Debose faces up to 20 years in prison.', ' The charges were announced by Loretta E. Lynch, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York,  James T. Hayes, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), New York; Joseph Anarumo, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), New York Field Division; Victor W. Lessoff, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), New York Field Office; and Sidney Simon, Special Agent-in-Charge, Department of Commerce (DOC), Office of Export Enforcement, New York Field Office.', ' Authorities initially learned of the arms smuggling scheme after police in China seized a package containing firearms with defaced serial numbers, which had been shipped from Queens, New York.  Upon learning of the seizure of the weapons, U.S. law enforcement officials traveled to China to examine the evidence.  The types of weapons seized by the Chinese authorities have been designated by the President of the United States on the United States Munitions List, and may not be exported without a license from the U.S. State Department.  With the aid of forensic techniques, agents determined that one of the weapons seized in China had originally been purchased in North Carolina.  Agents then traced that gun, and others, to Debose.  Agents arrested Debose in a sting operation when he arrived at a meeting location with a truckload of guns for the next shipment.  Debose was carrying a loaded .45 caliber pistol at the time of his arrest.  To date, four individuals have been charged with weapons trafficking and export offenses as a result of this investigation. ', ' \"The defendant traded the honor of his position in the National Guard for the money he received for smuggling arms to China.  In blatant disregard for everything he was sworn to uphold, the defendant placed numerous firearms into a black market pipeline from the United States to China,\" stated U.S. Attorney Lynch.  \"We utilize all available resources to stop the flow of illegal weapons through New York and overseas.  This case demonstrates the effectiveness of a collaboration among multiple federal law enforcement agencies and our foreign partners to address a global challenge.\"  Ms. Lynch expressed her grateful appreciation to the federal agencies that worked closely together to investigate the case. ', \" The government's case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Seth DuCharme, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Recker of the Department of Justice Counterespionage Section.  Assistance also was provided by the U.S. Attorneys' Offices in the Northern District of West Virginia and the Eastern District of North Carolina.\", 'The Defendant:', 'JOSEPH DEBOSE\\r\\n  Age: 30']\n",

Wray of \\r\\nthe Criminal Division and Acting United States Attorney Peter E. Papps for the \\r\\nDistrict of New Hampshire today announced the filing of an indictment against \\r\\nthree former executives of Enterasys Network Systems, Inc., a computer \\r\\nhardware and software corporation previously headquartered in Rochester, New \\r\\nHampshire, on fraud and related charges. In addition, a fourth executive \\r\\npleaded guilty to related charges on May 17, 2004. ', '\\r\\nThe charges against the indicted defendants stem from an alleged revenue \\r\\nrecognition scheme that involved altering and backdating contracts, entering \\r\\ninto secret side deals and making false representations in filings to the U.S. \\r\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in company press releases and to the \\r\\ncompanys outside auditors. ', '\\r\\nEnterasys succeeded Cabletron Systems, Inc., when the two companies merged in \\r\\nAugust 2001. Enterasys stock is publicly traded as ETS on the New York Stock \\r\\nExchange. Enterasys is now headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts. ', '\\r\\nThe 15-count indictment charges the three former executives with conspiracy, \\r\\nsecurities fraud, wire fraud and mail fraud. The indictment names: New \\r\\nHampshire resident Robert J. Gagalis, 49, former executive vice president and \\r\\nchief financial officer; Maine resident Bruce D. Kay, 52, former senior vice \\r\\npresident of finance; and New Hampshire resident Gayle Spence, a/k/a Gayle S. \\r\\nLuacaw, 45, former vice president and director of internal sales. ', '\\r\\nThe public is entitled to honest books that reflect the real value of a \\r\\ncompany, said Assistant Attorney General Wray. When corporate executives \\r\\nallegedly cook the books to create the illusion of success, they undermine the \\r\\nintegrity of the marketplace. ', '\\r\\nThe indictment alleges that Gagalis, Kay, Spence and others caused Enterasys \\r\\nto falsely report that it had met or exceeded internal revenue projections and \\r\\nWall Street expectations in order to maintain and increase the companys stock \\r\\nprice, as well as to enhance their own status and positions within the \\r\\ncompany. Specifically, at the close of the quarter ending on Sept. 1, 2001, \\r\\nthe companys outside auditors allegedly selected a number of transactions for \\r\\nrevenue testing, including a transaction with a China-based company known as \\r\\nAriel. As alleged in the indictment, the defendants and others became aware \\r\\nthat the transaction documents contained terms that would negate recognizing \\r\\napproximately $3.5 million in revenue. Fully aware of the companys efforts to \\r\\nmake its numbers for the sixth consecutive quarter, the defendants and \\r\\nothers allegedly caused one of the transaction documents to be altered by \\r\\ndeleting the problematic terms and then backdating the document to make it \\r\\nappear that it had been executed before the close of the quarter. The \\r\\ndefendants and others allegedly caused the altered and backdated document to \\r\\nbe sent to the companys outside auditors. In addition, the defendants and \\r\\nothers allegedly issued a secret side letter to Ariel, which they withheld \\r\\nfrom the auditors, that restated the problematic terms. As alleged in the \\r\\nindictment, after altering and backdating the documents, the defendants caused \\r\\nEnterasys to issue a press release and to make an SEC filing which included \\r\\nthe fraudulent revenue. ', '\\r\\nThe indictment also charges Spence in connection with an additional \\r\\ntransaction between Enterasys and a computer hardware and software developer \\r\\nknown as SAP. According to the indictment, SAP sought an 18-month right to \\r\\nexchange $1 million in computer products it was purchasing from Enterasys in \\r\\nthe final days of the quarter ending Dec. 29, 2001. The indictment alleges \\r\\nthat Spence and another senior Enterasys official agreed to the right of \\r\\nexchange but insisted that SAP not refer to the right of exchange in its \\r\\npurchase order, as it would negate revenue recognition. The indictment further \\r\\nalleges that Spence and the Enterasys official promised to include the \\r\\n18-month right of exchange in a secret side letter, which Spence then drafted \\r\\nand sent to SAP. After the fraud was uncovered, the company restated its \\r\\nearnings and reversed all of the revenue associated with the Ariel and SAP \\r\\ntransactions. ', '\\r\\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence on the conspiracy charge \\r\\n(18 U.S.C. SS 371) of five years in prison. The maximum sentence for securities \\r\\nfraud (15 U.S.C. SSSS 78j(b), 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), 78ff; 17 C.F.R. SSSS \\r\\n240.10b-5, 240.13b2-1 and 240.13b2-2) is 10 years in prison. Wire fraud (18 \\r\\nU.S.C. SS 1343) and mail fraud (18 U.S.C. SS 1341) each carry a maximum sentence \\r\\nof five years in prison per count. ', '\\r\\nIn addition, on May 17, 2004, Gary Workman, 57, a California resident and \\r\\nformer president of Enterasys APAC Division, pleaded guilty to a one-count \\r\\ncriminal information charging him with wire fraud for his participation in the \\r\\nfraudulent transaction with Ariel. Workman also entered into a cooperation \\r\\nagreement with the government. ', '\\r\\nThe investigation is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation \\r\\nand the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The case is being prosecuted by Fraud \\r\\nSection Trial Attorney Michael Koenig and Senior Counsel for Securities Fraud \\r\\nThomas Hanusik of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, and Assistant \\r\\nUnited States Attorney William Morse of the United States Attorneys Office \\r\\nfor the District of New Hampshire.

Vitaliano to violating the Arms Export Control Act and engaging in illegal weapons trafficking.  According to court documents and statements in court, Lin and others, including a former member of the U.S. National Guard, exported multiple shipments of firearms from the United States to China.  Lin and his accomplices secreted the weapons in packages and transported them to shipping companies, including a company in Queens, New York, to be sent to Shanghai.  The weapons included numerous semiautomatic handguns, rifles, and shotguns.  When sentenced, Lin faces up to 25 years in prison.', ' The guilty plea was announced by Loretta E.

With the aid of forensic techniques, agents determined that one of the weapons seized in China had originally been purchased in North Carolina.

      "[' One defendant was arraigned today, and another appeared in an ongoing removal hearing, in connection with their roles in a multi-national firearms trafficking investigation being conducted in the Eastern District of New York and elsewhere.  A criminal complaint was unsealed earlier this week in federal court in Brooklyn charging Joseph Debose, a resident of North Carolina and Staff Sergeant in a U.S. Special Forces National Guard Unit, with illegal gun dealing and aiding others, including Chinese nationals Zhifu Lin and Lilan Li, in the illegal export of firearms to China.1  Debose was arrested May 20, 2012, in a sting operation by federal agents in Smithfield, North Carolina, when he arrived to provide another shipment of firearms for export.  At the time of his arrest, Debose was carrying a loaded  .45 caliber pistol.  In addition, agents seized twelve other firearms from Debose, which were intended for export.', '\\r\\n  Lin was arraigned this morning before United States Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy, at the U.S. Courthouse, 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, New York, on an indictment previously returned by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York, and ordered detained.   Li was previously arraigned on that indictment on May 2, 2012, and entered a plea of not guilty.  Also this morning, at a proceeding in federal court in Raleigh, North Carolina, the government sought to remove Debose to the Eastern District of New York for prosecution on a related complaint.  The removal hearing was continued until May 30, 2012.  Debose remains in custody pending the outcome of that proceeding. ', ' The charges were announced by Loretta E. Lynch, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, James T. Hayes, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Joseph Anarumo, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), New York Field Division, Victor W. Lessoff, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), New York Field Office, and Sidney Simon, Special Agent-in-Charge, Department of Commerce (DOC), Office of Export Enforcement, New York Field Office.', \" According to the charging documents and facts presented by the government at Lin's arraignment, between December 2010 and April 2012, Debose provided multiple shipments of firearms to associates who then secreted the weapons in packages and transported them to shipping companies to be sent to customers in China.  The smuggling scheme came to light after authorities in China seized a package containing firearms with defaced serial numbers that had been shipped from Queens, New York.  Thereafter, U.S. law enforcement agents traveled to China and examined the firearms, which were determined to be listed on the United States Munitions List and barred from export without a license issued by the U.S. State Department.  Utilizing forensic techniques, agents learned that one of the seized weapons had originally been purchased in North Carolina.  Among the weapons seized in China were those Debose provided to his associates for export.  Last month, an indictment was unsealed in Brooklyn federal court charging Lin and Li with illegally exporting firearms, including the seized firearms mentioned above, from Queens to China without obtaining the required license from the State Department in violation of U.S. Arms Export Control Act.  Lin was also charged with operating an illegal gun-dealing business and transporting firearms with obliterated serial numbers. \", ' \"The defendants in North Carolina and New York allegedly ran a pipeline of illegal firearms from the United States to China.  We will utilize all available resources to stop the export of such weapons,\" stated United States Attorney Lynch.  \"The arrest of Debose marks the latest in a series of charges brought by this office against international gun traffickers.\"  Ms. Lynch expressed her grateful appreciation to the task force of federal agencies that worked together to investigate the case and added that the government\\'s investigation is continuing. ', ' \"The defendants allegedly altered the serial numbers on various weapons to disguise their origin in order to export them to China - an indication these guns were going to fall into the wrong hands,\" said HSI Special Agent-in-Charge Hayes.  \"HSI maintains a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to the illegal export of weapons on the United States Munitions List.\"', '\\r\\n  ATF Special Agent-in-Charge Anarumo stated, \"The unlawful purchasing and trafficking in firearms is a serious crime that feeds and amplifies the violence that is plaguing so many communities in this nation and around the world.  This investigation is a testament to the collective resolve of federal law enforcement to stem the flow of illegal firearms both within and outside of our nation\\'s borders.\"', ' IRS Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Lessoff stated, \"The potential harm that can result from the movement of illegal firearms through the New York City-metropolitan area cannot be overstated.  IRS-Criminal Investigation is enthusiastic about lending its financial investigative expertise to this ongoing investigation.\"', ' DOC Special Agent-in-Charge Simon stated, \"Special Agents from the Commerce Department\\'s Bureau of Industry and Security Office of Export Enforcement are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to stem the flow of firearms that are illegally smuggled out of the country.  We will continue to pursue arrests and convictions that ultimately shut-down these illicit schemes.\"', \" The defendants each face up to 20 years' imprisonment if convicted. \", \" The government's case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Seth DuCharme, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Recker of the Department of Justice Counter Espionage Section.

      "['WASHINGTON-- Gregg William Bergersen, age 51, of Alexandria, Virginia, was sentenced today in the Eastern District of Virginia to 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release for conspiracy to disclose national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it, in violation of 18 U.S.C., Sections 793(d) and (g). Bergersen pleaded guilty to this offense on March 31, 2008, after being arrested by federal authorities on February 11, 2008.', \"Patrick Rowan, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security; U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg of the Eastern District of Virginia; and Arthur M. Cummings, II, Executive Assistant Director of the FBI's National Security Branch, made the announcement after U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema imposed the sentence.\", '\"Mr. Bergersen betrayed his oath to serve and protect our nation when he used his government position to access and pass national defense information to a person he knew was not entitled to receive it. Today, he is paying the price for his actions,\" said Patrick Rowan, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security.', '\"Mr. Bergersen predicted he would go to jail if anyone discovered he was unlawfully providing classified information to a foreign government. We did. He is,\" said U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg.', '\"Espionage is one of the most serious crimes any American, much less a government official entrusted to serve and protect our Nation\\'s defense, can commit,\" said FBI Executive Assistant Director Arthur M. Cummings, National Security Branch. \"The FBI is working diligently with our partners in the law enforcement and intelligence community to safeguard America\\'s national defense information and to ensure individuals who commit such treasonous acts against the United States will be held fully accountable.\"', \"According to a Statement of Facts filed in Court with Bergersen's Plea Agreement, the criminal conduct spanned the time period of March 2007 to February 2008. During this time, Bergersen was a Weapons Systems Policy Analyst at the Arlington, Va.-based Defense Security Cooperation Agency, an agency within the Department of Defense. \", 'While in this position, Bergersen provided national defense information on numerous occasions to Tai Shen Kuo, a naturalized U.S. citizen and a New Orleans businessman. Much of the information pertained to U.S. military sales to Taiwan and was classified at the Secret level. ', \"During the course of the conspiracy, Kuo cultivated a friendship with Bergersen, bestowing on him gifts, cash payments, dinners, and money for gambling during trips to Las Vegas. Unbeknownst to Bergersen, Kuo passed along to an official of the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) the information Bergersen had provided him. As described in court documents, Kuo operated within the United States under the PRC official's direction, committing numerous acts of espionage during the time period of the conspiracy.\", \"In some of his meetings with Kuo, Bergersen cautioned that the information he was providing was classified. On one such occasion, in July 2007, Bergersen handed Kuo a classified document with jagged cut marks at the top and bottom of each page. Bergersen pointed out to Kuo that he had cut off the document's title and had also removed the classification markings from the top and bottom of every page, ensuring Kuo that he was being given classified information.\", 'On May 13, 2008, Tai Shen Kuo pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deliver national defense information to a foreign government, namely, the PRC, in violation of 18 U.S.C., Section 794(a), (c). Kuo is scheduled to be sentenced on August 8, 2008 and faces a maximum possible sentence of life in prison.', 'On May 28, 2008, another conspirator in the case, Yu Xin Kang of New Orleans, La., pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an unregistered agent of a foreign government, namely the PRC, in violation of 18 U.S.C., Sections 2 and 951. According to court documents, Kang assisted Kuo by periodically serving as a conduit for information between Kuo and the PRC official. Kang faces up to ten years in prison when she is sentenced on August 1, 2008.', 'The investigation was conducted by the FBI. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) provided substantial assistance and cooperation throughout the course of the investigation.', \"The prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Neil Hammerstrom and Aaron Zebley from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Trial Attorney Ryan Fayhee from the Counterespionage Section of the Justice Department's National Security Division.\", '###', '08-604']\n",

      "['BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - Twenty-nine defendants were charged in three separate\\r\\n  complaints with conspiracy to smuggle over 950 shipments of merchandise into the United\\r\\n  States principally from China - through ports of entry at Newark, New Jersey, Houston, Texas,\\r\\n  Long Beach, California, New York Container Terminal in Staten Island, New York, and John F.\\r\\n  Kennedy International Airport - and/or conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods. Four of the\\r\\n  defendants were also charged with money laundering. The charges are the result of a nineteenmonth\\r\\n  coordinated initiative by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\")\\r\\n  and Customs and Border Protection (\"Customs\"). The investigative techniques employed by\\r\\n  ICE agents and Customs officers included the use of cooperating witnesses, undercover agents,\\r\\n  and video and audio surveillance. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement\\r\\n  seized counterfeit merchandise which, had it been authentic, ICE and Customs estimate would\\r\\n  have been valued at approximately $700 million.', '  Those defendants who were arrested earlier today in New York and New Jersey are\\r\\n  scheduled to have their initial appearances this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge\\r\\n  Marilyn D. Go, at the U.S. Courthouse, 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, New York.', '  \"The investigation and prosecution of criminal activity at our ports of entry is essential to\\r\\n  the commerce of the United States,\" stated United States Attorney Roslynn R. Mauskopf.\\r\\n  \"Those who violate our borders for illegitimate financial gain will be met with all available\\r\\n  resources of law enforcement.\" Ms. Mauskopf thanked the New York City Police Department\\r\\n  and the United States Attorney\\'s Office for the Central District of California for their assistance\\r\\n  and added that the investigation is continuing.', '  \"Today\\'s arrests represent our intolerance for criminals who seek to circumvent the legal\\r\\n  customs process to smuggle contraband onto our streets,\" said Julie Myers, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"Counterfeiting has risen to the level of an economic pandemic costing the legitimate U.S. economy more than $200 billion annually. Targeting these illicit networks will remain one of the most important crimes we pursue.\"', 'Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner W.\\r\\n  Ralph Bashams stated, \"Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs\\r\\n  Enforcement are a powerful team when it comes to protecting the economic interests of our\\r\\n  country. Let there be no mistake that fraud against legitimate business is fraud against every one\\r\\n  of us.\"', '\\r\\n  Queens County, New York, District Attorney Richard A. Brown said, \"Trademark\\r\\n  counterfeiting is a multi-billion dollar a year industry that literally floods our streets with\\r\\n  counterfeit merchandise - items of inferior quality that mimic but fail to match the actual\\r\\n  trademarked product. The resulting economic impact on our society is lost royalties to the\\r\\n  legitimate owners of trademark products, the non-collection by government of substantial and\\r\\n  much-needed tax revenues, increased cost of governments to effectively combat this illegal\\r\\n  trade, and the ripping off of honest consumers who think they are getting brand name\\r\\n  merchandise at bargain prices. My office will continue to work with law enforcement officials\\r\\n  on all levels of government - including the New York City Police Department, the U.S.\\r\\n  Attorney\\'s Office, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement - to close down these\\r\\n  illegal operations and prosecute those involved to the full extent of the law.\"', 'IMPORTATION OF MERCHANDISE INTO THE UNITED STATES', '\\r\\n  Shipments of merchandise arriving at United States ports must be cleared, or granted\\r\\n  entry, by Customs prior to entering the commerce of the United States. The importer obtains\\r\\n  clearance through the use of a customs broker, an individual or company licensed by Customs to\\r\\n  file entry documents for commercial shipments. The importer presents the customs broker with\\r\\n  documents describing the shipment, including bills of lading, invoices, and packing lists. Based\\r\\n  on this information, Customs may clear a particular shipment, after assessing a duty, without\\r\\n  inspecting it. After a shipment is cleared, it may be removed from the port and delivered to the\\r\\n  importer or its customer. Counterfeit merchandise will be denied clearance and is subject to\\r\\n  seizure.', '\\r\\n  Shipments of merchandise may also enter the United States temporarily, and without\\r\\n  payment of duty, if it is to be delivered to another country. Such shipments require that only\\r\\n  Customs-bonded trucks pick up the merchandise at the port and that the shipment be temporarily\\r\\n  stored only at a Customs-bonded warehouse.', 'THE FIRST COMPLAINT', '  The first complaint, United States v. Kwok Keung Wong, et al., charges eighteen\\r\\n  defendants in two schemes to smuggle over 900 shipments of merchandise, both counterfeit and\\r\\n  authentic, including counterfeit Coach, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, and Balenciaga\\r\\n  handbags, Rolex watches, and Nike footwear, through John F. Kennedy Airport and ports of\\r\\n  entry at Newark, New Jersey, New York Container Terminal in Staten Island, New York, and\\r\\n  Long Beach, California. As part of the investigation, law enforcement seized counterfeit\\r\\n  merchandise worth, if authentic, in excess of $650 million.', '\\r\\n  In one scheme, between June 2005 and February 2007, freight forwarders KEUNG\\r\\n  WONG, CHI WONG, and SCHLOMO GREENBERG, and trucking company operators\\r\\n  RONALD DEPAOLA and JOSEPH DEPAOLA, and others, provided fraudulent shipping\\r\\n  documents to customs brokers, including JOHN SCIARA, to obtain entry of merchandise. The\\r\\n  documents falsely represented the nature and value of the merchandise in order to conceal the\\r\\n  fact that the goods were counterfeit or to avoid paying full duty for the authentic items. The\\r\\n  documents also contained false information about the identity of the importers, frequently listing\\r\\n  the name and identity of legitimate importers known to Customs. The WONGS, the\\r\\n  DEPAOLAS, and GREENBERG also filed false information in order to obtain \"Permits to\\r\\n  Transfer\" (PTTs). PTTs permit shipments to be moved from the port of entry to a\\r\\n  Customs-bonded facility where they must be held until Customs grants entry of the merchandise.\\r\\n  With respect to the fraudulently obtained PTTs, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed\\r\\n  to deliver the merchandise to the bonded facilities and actually transported it to their own\\r\\n  warehouses or the customers\\' warehouses. On occasion, when Customs required an inspection,\\r\\n  the defendants, including ROBERT ROSSOMANGO, a manager of a Customs-bonded\\r\\n  warehouse, allegedly provided the inspectors with substitute merchandise in order to conceal the\\r\\n  counterfeit nature or value of the merchandise and/or the fact that the goods had been delivered\\r\\n  prior to clearance by Customs.', '\\r\\n  In the second scheme, between March 2006 and June 2007, in an effort to conceal that\\r\\n  the imported merchandise was counterfeit or to avoid paying full duty for authentic merchandise,\\r\\n  (1) KEUNG WONG, importer YAKOUB SAADIA, and others, allegedly provided fraudulent\\r\\n  shipping documents to customs brokers, including HENRY MANDIL, to obtain entry of\\r\\n  counterfeit and authentic merchandise; (2) WONG, SAADIA, Customs-bonded warehouse\\r\\n  owners PHILLIP MCENTEE and JOSEPH VENETUCCI, and Customs-bonded warehouse\\r\\n  manager JOHN HSU allegedly fraudulently obtained PTTs to smuggle counterfeit and authentic\\r\\n  merchandise into the United States; (3) JUDY FRISCO and JAMES BALL, managers of a\\r\\n  Customs Exam Site - a Customs-bonded facility where Customs conducts commercial and\\r\\n  enforcement examinations of containers - allegedly moved shipments of merchandise from ports\\r\\n  of entry prior to examination by Customs to warehouses identified by SAADIA, and substituted\\r\\n  it with non-counterfeit goods or authentic goods with a lower duty; and (4) trucking company\\r\\n  operator MONIQUE ROLON, and others, filed applications with Customs falsely indicating that\\r\\n  shipments of merchandise were destined for Canada, not the United States.', '\\r\\n  The complaint also charges KEUNG WONG, CHI WONG, and SAADIA with money\\r\\n  laundering by wiring over $6 million from the United States to Hong Kong and China to\\r\\n  promote the smuggling schemes.', 'THE SECOND COMPLAINT', '\\r\\n  The second complaint, United States v. Longyi Wong, et al., charges nine defendants with\\r\\n  two schemes to smuggle counterfeit merchandise into the United States, including Nike\\r\\n  sneakers, North Face jackets, Burberry, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, and Fendi handbags, and\\r\\n  True Religion jeans, through ports of entry at Newark, New Jersey, Houston, Texas, and Long\\r\\n  Beach, California.', '\\r\\n  In the first scheme (the \"Diversion Scheme\"), between November 2005 and March 2006,\\r\\n  merchandise distributors LONGYI WANG, AMINE MOHSEN, AYMAN MOHSEN, and MIN\\r\\n  HUA YAO CHEN allegedly smuggled seven forty-foot containers with counterfeit goods\\r\\n  valued, if authentic, at over $9 million through the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach without\\r\\n  paying customs duties. They accomplished this by paying ICE agents, who were acting in\\r\\n  undercover capacities, to file paperwork falsely indicating that the containers were merely\\r\\n  passing through the United States and destined for Mexico. The containers were actually\\r\\n  delivered to several warehouses in the United States controlled by WANG and the MOHSENS,\\r\\n  and others. As part of the investigation, law enforcement seized containers of counterfeit\\r\\n  merchandise the defendants attempted to smuggle worth, if authentic, more than $11 million.', '\\r\\n  In the second scheme (the \"Pass-Through Scheme\"), between April 2006 and November\\r\\n  2006, WANG, the MOHSENS, and others, allegedly smuggled approximately twenty-two\\r\\n  containers with over $25 million of counterfeit merchandise into the United States by providing\\r\\n  false information to Customs regarding the contents, value, and consignees of the containers, and\\r\\n  paying ICE undercover agents to arrange the release of the merchandise by Customs. As part of\\r\\n  the investigation, law enforcement seized counterfeit merchandise the defendants attempted to\\r\\n  smuggle worth, had it been authentic, more than $38 million.', '\\r\\n  The complaint also charges WANG with money laundering by wiring funds from the\\r\\n  United States to Hong Kong and Spain to promote the smuggling schemes. CHEN is charged\\r\\n  with money laundering by conducting a financial transaction with the proceeds of trafficking in\\r\\n  counterfeit goods.', 'THE THIRD COMPLAINT', '\\r\\n  A third complaint, United States v. Danny Chan and Meng Zhang, charges the defendants\\r\\n  with conspiring to import counterfeit goods, including Coach handbags, into the United States\\r\\n  and to traffic in those goods.', '\\r\\n  In April 2007, CHAN, an employee of the Wen-Parker corporation, and ZHANG, the\\r\\n  president of CTS Logistics, allegedly arranged to ship cargo, including counterfeit handbags,\\r\\n  into the United States from abroad via air freight to John F. Kennedy Airport. When the cargo\\r\\n  arrived, it was transported to a Wen-Parker Customs-bonded warehouse where CHAN removed\\r\\n  the counterfeit goods to prevent their inspection and clearance by Customs.', 'MAXIMUM SENTENCES', \"\\r\\n  The charges in the complaints are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed\\r\\n  innocent unless and until proven guilty. If convicted, the defendants face maximum sentences of\\r\\n  five years' imprisonment for the conspiracy charges and twenty years' imprisonment for the money laundering charges.\", \"The government's cases are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys\\r\\n  Elizabeth Latif and Daniel Silver.\\r\\n\"]\n",

Cogan to trafficking in counterfeit goods in  violation of criminal trademark laws.  The defendants admitted during the  plea hearings to having trafficked in a combined total of 518,028 tubes of  counterfeit Colgate toothpaste with an estimated retail value of $730,419.   At sentencing, the individual defendants each face up to ten years in prison, a  fine of $2 million and three years of supervised release following their  release from prison.  The two corporate defendants face up to a $5 million  fine, restitution and up to five years of organizational probation.   Sentencing has been set for Jan. 9, 2009.', 'According  to the criminal informations filed in the case, laboratory tests conducted by  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Colgate-Palmolive on samples of the  counterfeit toothpaste revealed that the toothpaste lacked fluoride, an  ingredient found in genuine Colgate toothpaste, and that some of the toothpaste  contained microorganisms, such as bacillus spores and diethylene glycol.   Diethylene glycol, commonly used as a coolant for hydraulic and brake fluids,  is illegally used in the production of counterfeit health care products to  provide lubrication and help products maintain moisture.  According to the FDA, the level of diethylene  glycol contained in the counterfeit toothpaste can pose health and safety risks  to all consumers but primarily to individuals with compromised immune systems,  children and infants.  ', \"The  informations revealed that the packaging on the counterfeit toothpaste was  substantially indistinguishable from the legitimate Colgate-Palmolive product  except that it contained spelling and grammatical errors as well as erroneously  stating that the toothpaste was made in South Africa,  even though all of the product was imported from the People's Republic of China.   Most of the counterfeit toothpaste at issue was sold by the defendants to  secondary distributors and small to medium-sized discount stores throughout  several states in the United    States.\", '\"These defendants undermined the basic precept that  consumers are safe to assume that when they purchase retail health and safety  products, they are buying what the label says they are buying.  A parent should never have to fear that buying  an everyday item like toothpaste could put a family at risk,\" said Acting Assistant  Attorney General Matthew Friedrich. \"This case demonstrates the Department\\'s  continued commitment to prosecute aggressively criminals who seek to profit by importing  and distributing counterfeit goods that put our citizens\\' health and safety in  jeopardy.\"', '\\r\\n  \"The  defendants lined their own pockets by trafficking in counterfeit goods without  concern for the dangers those goods posed to the health and safety of  consumers,\" said Benton J. Campbell, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of  New York.  \"These convictions demonstrate our continuing commitment to  protect public safety and manufacturers\\' property rights.\"', '\\r\\n  \"Something  as routine as brushing your teeth should not be dangerous.  Consumers should not have to worry that  criminals have tampered with the products they use or ingest,\" said Julie L.  Myers, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE).  \"The risks that substandard, tainted and counterfeit  products pose to the health and safety of consumers are real and a threat we  take very seriously.  ICE and its federal  partners are working together to comprehensively investigate these crimes and  to ensure American consumers can have confidence in the products they  purchase.\"', '\"Those who deal in counterfeit health products are solely  motivated be greed.  They prey upon  an unsuspecting public with no regard  for potentially placing the public\\'s health at risk.  We will continue to  work with our law enforcement partners to pursue these counterfeiters to the  fullest extent of the law,\" said Terry Vermillion, Director, FDA Office of  Criminal Investigations. ', \"\\r\\n  As  explained in court documents, Mabass Inc., incorporated in New York in March 2004, was an importer and  wholesale distributor of general merchandise, including detergent and  toothpaste.  Between approximately May 2006 and March 2007, Mabass  imported seven shipments of counterfeit Colgate toothpaste from the People's  Republic of China  and admitted during the plea hearing to continuing to import counterfeit  toothpaste despite learning in November 2006 that the last three shipments  contained 432,000 tubes that were counterfeit.  \", \"Defendants  Diallo and Bah were principals of Afro Atlantic Corp., incorporated in New York State in March 2005, according to  documents filed in court.  During the plea hearing, defendants Diallo and  Bah admitted that, in August 2006, they knowingly imported a shipment of  approximately 82,944 tubes of counterfeit Colgate counterfeit toothpaste from  the People's Republic of China.\", \"Vidtape  Inc., incorporated in New York in January  1988, was a reseller of merchandise that operated from Farmingdale, N.Y.   According to court documents, between approximately November 2006 and  June 2007, Vidtape purchased approximately 3,084 tubes of counterfeit Colgate  toothpaste that had been imported by others from the People's Republic of China and resold it to a buyer in Toronto.  Vidtape  admitted that although it learned that the toothpaste was counterfeit while it  was on route to Canada,  Vidtape failed to recall the shipment or notify the buyer that the product was  counterfeit.  The counterfeit toothpaste was later seized by Health Canada,  the department within the Canadian government charged with responsibility for  public health, working in conjunction with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\", 'Colgate-Palmolive,  a global consumer products company with sales in 2007 of $13.8 billion, sells  toothpaste and toothbrushes in more than 200 countries and territories around  the world.  In addition to providing assistance to this investigation, Colgate-Palmolive  undertook its own national action to inspect several thousand small  to medium discount stores to identify and remove any counterfeit toothpaste  falsely labeled as Colgate.', \"\\r\\n  The  case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Matthew J. Bassiur of the Criminal  Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S.  Attorney Lee J. Freedman, Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Coordinator  for the Eastern District of New York. The case was investigated by the New York offices of ICE  and the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations.\", ' ']\n",

      "['\\n\\r\\n        WILMINGTON, Del. - Charles M. Oberly, III, United States Attorney for the District of Delaware, announced that Su Lian Wu, age 54, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Sue L. Robinson to 8 months incarceration for trafficking in counterfeit cigarettes.', '        According to statements made and documents filed in court, Wu was the last of six defendants to plead guilty to trafficking in counterfeit cigarettes and be sentenced by Judge Robinson. On six occasions, from April 2010 through December 2010, the six defendants variously brought to Delaware from Flushing, New York City, where they each resided, a total of 2,580 cartons of counterfeit cigarettes, which had been imported from the Peopleas Republic of China. These counterfeit cigarette packs and cartons appear identical to those of a popular American brand, which has trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The defendants unwittingly sold the 2,580 cartons of counterfeit cigarettes to witnesses cooperating with special agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Accordingly, these counterfeit cigarettes were not sold to the public. The equivalent wholesale price for a similar quantity of genuine cigarettes exceeds $100,000. The counterfeit cigarettes bore various state cigarette tax stamps, also all counterfeit.', '        Among the five defendants previously sentenced are Wuas husband and son, respectively, Jin Ming Zhang, age 56, and Wei Feng Zhang, age 33. The family emigrated to the United States from the Peopleas Republic of China in 1997 on visitor visas. While overstaying those visas, each applied for and received permanent legal residency (a green card). In February 2011, Jin Ming Zhang was arrested on the Delaware charges at the JFK International Airport in New York City, upon arriving on a flight from the Peopleas Republic of China. He remained a pretrial detainee for the 11 months from his arrest through January 11, 2012, when he was sentenced to atime serveda and a $2,000 fine. Wei Feng Zhang, who has a 2008 New York conviction related to counterfeit cigarettes, similarly was sentenced, on March 1, 2012, to 11 months incarceration.', '        Also among the five previously sentenced defendants is Tian Yun Qu, age 25, and his mother, Shao Chai Weng, age 49. Qu served 42 days as a pretrial detainee before being sentenced to atime serveda on September 21, 2011. Five days later, on September 26, 2011, Weng similarly was sentenced to 42 days incarceration and a $5,000 fine. The remaining\\r\\n        defendant, Liang Jiang, age 25, on October 13, 2011, was also sentenced to 42 days atime served.a\\r\\n        In sentencing Wu to 8 months incarceration, United States District Court Judge Sue L. Robinson noted that of the six defendants only Wu and her family had direct contact with the source of the counterfeit cigarettes and thus their sentences were greater.', '        Qu, Weng, and Jiang immigrated to the United States from the Peopleas Republic of China and were granted permanent legal status in the United States. Each of the six defendants, when entering his/her guilty plea, was warned by Judge Robinson that the conviction possibly could impact that status.', '        The sentences imposed on all defendants include a three year term of supervised release, to commence after incarceration.\\r\\n        Following the sentencing hearing, Charles M. Oberly, III, United States Attorney for the District of Delaware stated, aTrafficking in counterfeit merchandise presents severe economic consequences. The U. S. Chamber of Commerce, in a 2005 study, estimated that between 5% and 7% of world trade is in counterfeit goods, the equivalent of greater than $500 billion in global lost sales. When cases such as this are brought to my office, they will be prosecuted.a', '        aThis case exemplifies the collaboration between ATF and our federal, state, and local partners,a said ATF Baltimore Field Division Acting Special Agent in Charge Debbie D. Bullock. aAll of the entities involved in the investigation can site this prosecution as a prime example of the successful use of federal laws to confront, engage, and eliminate those who attempt to generate revenue from criminal activity.a', '        Tom Cook, Delaware Secretary of Finance, stated, aThis case highlights the success of the federal and state government in working together to investigate and prosecute those who illegally distribute untaxed and counterfeit cigarettes in the State of Delaware a and the continuing need for such investigations. This type of criminal activity undermines legitimate retailers through tax evasion, puts an inferior product on the streets, and costs the State of Delaware significant tax revenue.a']\n",

      "['BRYAN POLEE, 28, a former Whidbey Island resident, who now resides in   Riverside, California, was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Seattle to   36 months in prison, three years of supervised release and $1.6 million in   restitution for Trafficking in Counterfeit Goods. POLEE pleaded guilty in   February 2009, to a scheme to import counterfeit goods and sell them on eBay.   Many of the items sold are heavily advertised in infomercials on television.   Originally, POLEE was released pending sentencing, but was remanded to custody   on September 3, 2009, for continuing to traffic in counterfeit goods, by selling   counterfeit items on eBay. In discussing Mr. Poleeas decision to leave the   military for the more profitable endeavor of selling counterfeit goods, Chief   U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik reminded the defendant that amaking more   money doesnat necessarily make a better life for your son,a particularly when   that decision results in your incarceration. ', 'According to records filed in the case, between at least January 2005, and   April 2008, POLEE imported counterfeit goods from China through his company ZMP   Enterprises, in Oak Harbor, Washington. POLEE purchased the goods, mainly   fitness equipment, from a Chinese supplier and sold them over the internet a   primarily via eBay. The goods were labeled with counterfeit trademarks making it   appear as though they were made by various reputable manufacturers, such as   Fitness Quest, Homeland Housewares, OneUp Innovations, and Nautilus, Inc. POLEE   was paid more than $2.1 million for the counterfeit goods he sold over eBay.', 'POLEE sold at least 3177 counterfeit Bowflex units with a value of more than   $1 million. Bowflex is a trademarked fitness unit sold by Nautilus Inc. POLEE   sold at least 149 counterfeit units of the AB Lounge made by Fitness Quest worth   more than $15,000. POLEE sold at least 1854 counterfeit Magic Bullet blenders   made by Homeland Housewares worth more than $83,000 and he sold 401 counterfeit   Liberator Cushions made by OneUp Innovations worth more than $62,000.', 'At the time of his plea, POLEE agreed to forfeit to the government $30,000 in   cash, a 2003 Cadillac CTS and a 2000 Jaguar S-Type. However, POLEE no longer has   the money to forfeit, and in fact had returned to his criminal conduct while   released from custody. In July 2009, prosecutors received information that POLEE   was once again selling counterfeit goods online. A search at his California   residence turned up nearly $70,000 in counterfeit goods. PayPal records revealed   that from March to July 2009, he had taken in about $50,000 for the sale of   goods believed to be counterfeit.', 'In asking for a 57 month prison sentence, Assistant United States Attorney   Mary K. Dimke told the court that POLEE had continued with his criminal actions   despite civil suits filed by companies whose goods were counterfeited, and   despite criminal prosecution. aTime and time again, Mr. Polee made the decision   that he would prefer to engage in lucrative criminal activity rather than   respect the rights of individuals who worked legitimate jobs to build the   reputation of the various victim trademark holders, while also exposing the   public to potentially dangerous and unsafe products,a Ms. Dimke wrote in her   sentencing memo.', 'aIn pursuit of a quick profit, the defendant peddled counterfeit goods on the   Internet, selling brand name items to an unsuspecting public,a said Brad Bench,   acting special agent in charge of ICEas Office of Investigations. aBecause this   type of crime victimizes consumers and harms the economic interests of   legitimate businesses, ICE will continue to aggressively investigate those who   engage in this type of activity.a', 'The case was investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and   Customs and Border Protection. The case was prosecuted by Assistant United   States Attorney Mary K. Dimke.', 'For additional information please contact Emily Langlie, Public Affairs   Officer for the United States Attorneyas Office, at (206) 553-4110 or   Emily.Langlie@USDOJ.Gov.', 'Return to Top']\n",

RULLAN pleaded guilty in June   2010, following an undercover investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs   Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). RULLAN admitted she   knowingly imported and sold counterfeit exercise equipment. In sentencing RULLAN   to prison time, U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez noted that athere were   many, many false statements to customs and to customers . . . there were many   overt acts to keep this scheme going.a', 'According to records filed in the case, in November 2009, an HSI agent   working undercover communicated with RULLAN over the internet about the   authenticity of the aAb Circle Proa exercisers she was selling on the auction   site eBay. RULLAN responded that the item was not a fake, and said it was just   lower priced because that was the going rate on eBay. In December 2009, HSI   agents made a court authorized search of RULLANas home and seized 210   counterfeit aAb Circle Proa units. Agents also seized evidence of a double   invoicing scheme, as well as other counterfeit exercise equipment. The   investigation revealed that in 2008 and 2009, RULLAN had sold more than 1,000   counterfeit items on eBay.', 'RULLAN admitted to agents and in her plea agreement that she knew the items   were counterfeit, but nevertheless assured both eBay and her customers that they   were not. RULLAN provided a letter to eBay falsely claiming that she was an   authorized distributor of the aAb Circle Proa for Fitness Brands Inc. When   customers complained about the low quality of the item they purchased, RULLAN   continued to claim they were the genuine item. Those claims hurt the legitimate   company. \\n\\r\\n          aWhen a counterfeiter like Ms. Rullan sells an illegitimate   product, trademark holders suffer direct and immediate financial harm, in the   form of lost purchases of their legitimate product... Trademark holders also   suffer more indirect harm, such as the damage to their reputation when the   counterfeit products turn out to be low-quality and faulty, as were the products   sold by Ms. Rullan....a Assistant United States Attorney Matthew Diggs wrote in   his sentencing memo.', 'aThis case serves as a reminder that the sale and purchase of counterfeit   goods is not a victimless crime,a said Leigh Winchell, HSI special agent in   charge in Seattle. aThis type of illegal behavior robs legitimate businesses of   millions of dollars in lost revenue and provides an unwitting public with   sub-par merchandise. HSI will continue to investigate these crimes in an effort   to deter this activity in the United States and around the world.a \\n\\r\\n          In fiscal   year 2009, HSIas investigations resulted in the seizure of more than $62 million   in pirated and counterfeit goods.

She was acquitted on one count of false statements  and one count of money laundering.  The jury reached its verdict on May  24, 2011, after a 12-day trial and nearly four days of deliberations.   Today, the jury returned a verdict regarding the forfeiture of numerous assets  associated with Zhao, including two Porsches, one Mercedes, seven bank accounts  containing more than $1.6 million, and four homes and three condominiums with a  total value of more than $2.6 million.

JDC Networking Inc. altered Cisco products by using  pirated software, and created labels and packaging in order to mislead  consumers into believing the products it sold were genuine Cisco  products.

A subsequent ICE investigation, including a review of\\r\\ndocuments filed with CBP, disclosed that Lam, Chan, and Yuen engaged in a\\r\\ncorporate shell game whereby they conspired to, and in fact imported, over\\r\\n300,000 counterfeit luxury handbags and wallets into the United States from the\\r\\nPRC in the names of different companies, all under their control.

According to the indictment, Fox has owned and operated businesses located on   West Florissant, Cherokee Street and the Frison Flea Market, wherein Fox   routinely sold counterfeit goods, some which originated in China.  Fox has  also   maintained an inventory of components for making counterfeit purses, including   almost 6000 counterfeit purse labels that were designed and intended to be used   in creating counterfeit goods.\", 'Fox, also known as   Soukeye Samb and Sue Fox, was indicted by a federal Grand Jury Thursday on one   felony count of trafficking in counterfeit goods.  The indictment was suppressed   until the arrest of the defendant earlier today.', 'If convicted, this   charge carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and/or fines up to $2   million.

Tompkins, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.  Borodin also pleaded guilty to delivering and causing to be delivered hazardous material, that being airbags, by air commerce in violation of rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation.  ', 'U.S. Attorney Tompkins is joined in making todayas announcement by Brock D. Nicholson, Special Agent in Charge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementas (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Georgia and the Carolinas, and Marlies T. Gonzalez, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General (DOT-OIG),  Region IV.', 'On August 21, 2012, a federal criminal indictment charged Borodin with one count of trafficking and attempting to traffic in counterfeit airbags bearing the registered trademarks of automobile manufacturers, and one count of delivering and causing to be delivered hazardous materials (airbags) to air carriers for transportation in air commerce.', 'According to filed court documents and related court proceedings, Borodin is part-owner of Krugger Auto, located in Charlotte.  On August 16, 2012,  law enforcement agents with ICE-HSIas Charlotte and Chattanooga, Tenn. offices and DOT-OIG agents executed federal search warrants at Krugger Auto and Borodinas residence in Indian Trail.  Court records show that while executing the search warrants, agents recovered 99 counterfeit airbags from Borodinas business and 1,514 counterfeit airbags from his residence.  Court records also show that Borodin had purchased the counterfeit airbags from China, which he then resold through eBay.  According to filed documents and court proceedings, the counterfeit airbag shipments ordered by Borodin did not display the legally-required hazardous material warnings when the shipments were transported in air commerce from China to the United States.', 'The Department of Transportation has classified airbags as Class 9 dangerous goods, and as such they must be classified, documented, packaged, marked and labeled in accordance with the Hazardous Materials Regulations.  The transportation of airbags without legally-required warnings of the hazardous material contained in airbag shipments pose a safety risk to all persons transporting and handling the unmarked hazardous materials.', 'According to court records, Borodin sold at least an estimated 7,000 counterfeit airbags online, and between February 2011 and May 2012 Borodin earned at least $1.4 million dollars in revenue from the eBay sales of the counterfeit airbags.  Independent testing of a counterfeit airbag sold in September 2011 by Borodin through eBay showed that the airbag did not properly inflate.', 'aMy office will not allow fake airbags to endanger the safety of the drivers in our communities,a said U.S. Attorney Tompkins in making todayas announcement of the guilty plea.  aAirbags that do not meet the quality and safety standards of the automobile manufacturers pose a serious threat to human life because they fail to work when they are needed the most, during a car accident.  Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warned consumers of the serious threat posed by counterfeit airbags, which range from failure to inflate during a front-end collision, to expelling flames and shrapnel toward car occupants upon deployment.  With the help of our law enforcement partners, we will continue to go after those who distribute counterfeit airbags in the market.a  ', 'aDrivers should not have to worry about whether or not their air bags will shoot shrapnel at them in the event of an accident,a said Brock D. Nicholson, special agent in charge of HSI Atlanta. aHSI is committed to doing everything we can to keep dangerous and counterfeit substandard safety equipment from entering our marketplace and our cars. We encourage anyone who believes they may have been a victim of this fraud to visit safercar.gov for more information.a', 'aPublic safety and consumer protection are among our top investigative priorities.  These unscrupulous acts are committed against people who do not even realize the danger they have been put in,a said DOT OIG Special Agent in Charge Marlies Gonzalez.  aWorking with our law enforcement and prosecutorial partners, we will continue to leverage our resources to bring to justice those who violate the law and risk the lives of others.a', 'Borodin entered his plea of guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David S. Cayer.  Count one (trafficking in counterfeit airbags) carries a maximum term of ten years in prison and a $2 million fine.  Count two (delivering hazardous material) carries a maximum prison term of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.', 'At todayas plea hearing, Judge Cayer also issued a consent order and judgment of forfeiture based on the charges contained in the indictment.  Pursuant to the consent order, the Court found that, as a result of his criminal conduct, Borodin obtained $1,743,400 in proceeds which he must forfeit.  In addition, the Court ordered forfeiture of numerous specific properties including Borodinas residence, all of the seized counterfeit airbags, and $60,000 in cash seized from his Indian Trail home. ', 'Borodin has been in local federal custody since his arrest on August 16, 2012.  He will remain in custody until his sentencing hearing, which has not been scheduled yet.

The package contained 1,025 counterfeit Disney DVDs in 41 individually wrapped boxes labeled aBaby Einstein DVD Collection.a  On April 10, 2008, an agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement located an individual selling aBaby Einstein DVD collectionsa on eBay using the name ababygeniusmontessori,a with a location of Beltsville, Maryland.  After confirming with Disney that these were not authorized DVDs, on May 7, 2008, the agent made an undercover purchase of a aBaby Einstein DVD Collectiona  for $45.98 from ababygeniusmontessori,a who was identified as Yong Liu.  On May 8, 2008, Disney issued a aCease and Desist Noticea to Young Liu advising that her sales on eBay were in violation of Disneyas copyrights and demanding that she stop her sales of counterfeit Disney products.', 'Despite Disneyas notice, on May 28, 2008, agents learned that Yong Liu was continuing to sell the counterfeit Disney DVDs on eBay, although she had changed her seller account name and e-mail address.  Agents again made an undercover purchase of one aBaby Einstein DVD Collectiona and confirmed by the return address on the package that the sender was Yong Liu.  A search warrant executed at Liuas home on September 24, 2008 recovered 2,132 packaged DVDs, including multiple collections that were prepared for shipment.  The eBay/PayPal records for Liuas accounts show that from May 1 to May 10, 2008, Liu sold more than 10 copies of Baby Einstein DVD collections, receiving more than $6,000 for those collections.

Ralph Basham, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and\\r\\nInspector Peter Goulet of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) today\\r\\nannounced the results to date of an ongoing international enforcement initiative\\r\\nbetween the United States and Canada that targets the illegal distribution of\\r\\ncounterfeit network hardware manufactured in China.', '\\tThis ongoing initiative has resulted in more than 400 seizures of counterfeit\\r\\nCisco network hardware and labels with an estimated retail value of more than\\r\\n$76 million.  It is being led by ICE, CBP and the FBI working in conjunction\\r\\nwith the Criminal Divisions Computer Crime & Intellectual Property Section,\\r\\nU.S. Attorneys Offices across the country, and the RCMP.', '\\tThe initiative targets the illegal importation and sale of counterfeit network\\r\\nhardware, in particular network routers, switches, network cards and modules\\r\\nmanufactured by Cisco.  By intercepting the counterfeit hardware at ports of\\r\\nentry and dismantling illegal supply chains in the U.S., the operation has\\r\\nachieved significant successes in protecting the public from the risk of network\\r\\ninfrastructure failures associated with these counterfeits.', 'Counterfeit network hardware entering the marketplace raises significant public\\r\\nsafety concerns and must be stopped.  This initiative shows that through\\r\\ncollaboration among law enforcement agencies and prosecutors worldwide, we can\\r\\nachieve dramatic enforcement results and protect public safety, said Assistant\\r\\nAttorney General Alice S. Fisher of the Criminal Division.  It is critically\\r\\nimportant that network administrators in both private sector and government\\r\\nperform due diligence in order to prevent counterfeit hardware from being\\r\\ninstalled on their networks.', '\\tThe FBI named its portion of this ongoing initiative Operation Cisco Raider -\\r\\nan international, coordinated investigation of 15 cases involving nine FBI field\\r\\noffices.  The FBI worked closely with law enforcement partners including ICE,\\r\\nDefense Criminal Investigative Service, General Services Administration,\\r\\nDepartment of the Interior, Internal Revenue Service, and the RCMP.  Over the\\r\\nlast two years, Operation Cisco Raider has resulted in 36 search warrants that\\r\\nidentified approximately 3,500 counterfeit network components with an estimated\\r\\nretail value of over $3.5 million, and has led to a total of ten convictions and\\r\\n$1.7 million in restitution.', '\\tThis operation illustrates the importance of working closely with our partners\\r\\nin both law enforcement and the private sector, said FBI Assistant Director\\r\\nJames Finch.  Cisco Systems Incorporated specifically deserves praise for their\\r\\nlevel of cooperation in this initiative.  We will continue these efforts to\\r\\naggressively investigate counterfeit goods in order to protect U.S. consumers\\r\\nand corporations.', '\\tICE and CBP opened a total of 28 investigations in 17 separate field offices\\r\\nsince 2005; eight of those investigations were worked jointly with the FBI and\\r\\nseveral with the RCMP.  ICE agents have conducted 115 seizures of counterfeit\\r\\nCisco products having an estimated retail value of $20.4 million.  ICE\\r\\ninvestigations have led to six indictments and four felony convictions to date. \\r\\nCBP has made 373 seizures of counterfeit Cisco network hardware since 2005, and\\r\\n40 seizures of Cisco labels for counterfeit products.  All together, ICE and CBP\\r\\nseized more than 74,000 counterfeit Cisco network components and labels with a\\r\\ntotal estimated retail value of more than $73 million.', '\\tCrimes like these threaten international commerce, national security and the\\r\\nvery safety of our citizens, said Julie L. Myers, Homeland Security Assistant\\r\\nSecretary for ICE.  Throughout this investigation, the cooperation and\\r\\npartnership that we received from Cisco Systems, our law enforcement colleagues,\\r\\nand Chinese counterparts are a clear example of the results that can be realized\\r\\nthrough industry, interagency and international cooperation.', 'The success of this operation demonstrates our commitment to work jointly with\\r\\nour law enforcement partners, as well as the private sector, to stop\\r\\ninternational trafficking in counterfeit items and protect our consumers and\\r\\nbusinesses from these dangerous goods, stated CBP Commissioner W. Ralph Basham.', 'Today in Toronto, Canada, the RCMP charged two individuals and a company with\\r\\ndistributing large quantities of counterfeit network components to companies in\\r\\nthe United States via the Internet.  The RCMP seized approximately 1,600 pieces\\r\\nof counterfeit network hardware with an estimated value of $2 million.  This\\r\\nprosecution resulted from a joint initiative between the RCMP, FBI, ICE, and CBP\\r\\nthat was aimed at disrupting the flow of counterfeit Cisco networking components\\r\\nin North America.', 'Counterfeit products greatly undermine the integrity of our economy, stated\\r\\nInspector Peter Goulet, Officer in Charge of the RCMP Greater Toronto Area\\r\\nFederal Enforcement Section.  In many cases the end users were unaware that\\r\\ncounterfeit products were being placed on their computer networks, and depending\\r\\non the function of those networks, this could cause serious health and safety\\r\\nconcerns.', '\\r\\nSome of the cases involved with this initiative across the United States\\r\\ninclude the following:', '\\r\\n-On February 14, 2008, in the Northern District of Georgia, Todd Richard, 33,\\r\\nwas sentenced to 36 months imprisonment and ordered to pay $208,440 in\\r\\nrestitution to Cisco Systems, Inc., as a result of his conviction for\\r\\ntrafficking in counterfeit Cisco computer products.  From late 2003 until early\\r\\n2007, Richard imported shipments of counterfeit Cisco computer components from\\r\\nChina, and separate shipments of counterfeit Cisco labels.  He then affixed the\\r\\nfake labels to the fake components and sold the products on eBay, claiming that\\r\\nthey were legitimate Cisco items.   Richard sold over $1 million worth of\\r\\ncounterfeit Cisco products in this manner.

The indictment alleges that\\r\\nthe Edmans purchased and imported the counterfeit computer network hardware from\\r\\nan individual in China.  They later sold the counterfeit Cisco products to\\r\\nretailers of computer network products throughout the United States.  According\\r\\nto the indictment, the Edmans shipped some of the counterfeit hardware directly\\r\\nto the Marine Corps, Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration, FBI, defense\\r\\ncontractors, universities and financial institutions. These entities had\\r\\npurchased the product from a computer retailer serving as a middleman, which in\\r\\nturn purchased the products from the Edmans (a process known as drop\\r\\nshipping).  The case was investigated by ICE and is being prosecuted by the\\r\\nU.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Texas.', '\\r\\n-On April 17, 2007, in the Northern District of Texas, Mark Thomas Geis, 37,\\r\\nwas sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay $1.5 million in\\r\\nrestitution to Cisco Systems Inc. as a result of his conviction for conspiracy\\r\\nto traffic in counterfeit network hardware.  The court found that Geis, doing\\r\\nbusiness as VARGlobal and conducting business via eBay, conspired to traffic in\\r\\napproximately $4.2 million of counterfeit Cisco hardware.  This case was\\r\\ninvestigated by the FBI.  Geis had previously been convicted and sentenced to 46\\r\\nmonths imprisonment in 2001 for conspiracy to defraud Microsoft Corporation. \\r\\nThe case was investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys\\r\\nOffice for the Northern District of Texas.', '\\r\\nThe problem of trafficking in counterfeit computer components is a global\\r\\nproblem, as reflected by last weeks announcement by the European Union (EU) and\\r\\nU.S. officials of the first EU-U.S. customs joint operation resulting in the\\r\\nseizure of more than 360,000 counterfeit computer parts and integrated circuits.\\r\\n The joint initiative between the European Commission Tax and Customs\\r\\nDirectorate and CBP took place during a three-week period in November and\\r\\nDecember of 2007.  A probe in five countries uncovered a pattern of trade in\\r\\ncounterfeit networking equipment and integrated circuits passed off as products\\r\\nfrom 40 of the worlds largest European, U.S., Japanese, and Korean technology\\r\\ncompanies.  Most arrived via air shipment from China, but some were also shipped\\r\\nfrom Taiwan and Hong Kong.', 'U.S. law enforcement authorities continue to work with Chinas Ministry of\\r\\nPublic Security (MPS) to combat the manufacture and export of counterfeit\\r\\nnetwork hardware from China.  This ongoing work is being facilitated by the IP\\r\\nCriminal Enforcement Working Group of the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group for law\\r\\nenforcement, which is co-chaired by the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department\\r\\nof Justice and the MPS. The Working Group is dedicated to increasing cooperation\\r\\nin intellectual property law enforcement efforts and pursuing more joint IP\\r\\ncriminal investigations with China.', \"\\r\\nThe initiative announced today is part of a broader Department of Justice\\r\\ninitiative to combat all forms of intellectual property crime, including\\r\\neconomic espionage, copyright infringement, and trafficking in counterfeit\\r\\ngoods.

Through the dedicated efforts of U.S.\\r\\nAttorney's Offices and federal law enforcement across the country, in FY2007,\\r\\n287 defendants were convicted and sentenced on intellectual property charges,\\r\\nrepresenting a 35 percent increase over FY2006 and a 92 percent increase over\\r\\nFY2005.  Additionally, the Department filed 217 intellectual property cases last\\r\\nyear, representing a 7 percent increase over cases reported in FY2006 and a 33\\r\\npercent increase over cases reported in FY2005.\", '\\r\\nCisco Systems, Inc. has cooperated with U.S. and Canadian law enforcement\\r\\nauthorities and provided exceptional assistance throughout these investigations.', 'The investigations are ongoing throughout the U.S.', '###', '08-150']\n",

      "[\"ALEXANDRIA, Va. a Two Chinese nationals were sentenced to 24 months in  prison today for participating in a conspiracy to violate the Arms Export  Control Act and smuggle radiation-hardened microchips from the United States  for an agency controlled by the Peopleas Republic of China (PRC) and  responsible for the development of missiles and launch vehicles. \\r\\n         Neil H. MacBride, United States  Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney  General for National Security; John P. Torres, Special Agent in Charge for ICE,  Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Washington, D.C.; and  Robert E. Craig, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative  Serviceas (DCIS) Mid-Atlantic Field Office, made the announcement after  sentencing by United States District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee.\\r\\n          aThe line between traditional  espionage, export violations and economic espionage has become increasingly  blurred as the sensitive information sought by the PRC commonly has ramifications  both economically and in terms of national security,a said U.S. Attorney  MacBride. aTodayas sentences should serve as a deterrent to anyone who might  seek to illegally obtain sensitive information for the PRC. The person they are  dealing with may turn out to be a federal undercover agent.a\\r\\n            aThe protection of Americaas most sensitive technologies, particularly those  with defense applications, is among HSIas most critical of missions,a said ICE  HSI SAC Torres. aICE HSI will continue to work with our foreign and federal law  enforcement partners to ensure that those who illegally export sensitive  materials are identified, investigated, and brought to the U.S to face  prosecution.a\\r\\n          On June 1, 2011, Hong Wei Xian,  a/k/a aHarry Zan,a 32, and Li Li, a/k/a aLea Li,a 33, both from the PRC, pled  guilty to conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act and to smuggle  goods unlawfully from the United States. \\r\\n          Xian and Li were officers of  Beijing Starcreates Space Science and Technology Development Company Limited  (Beijing Starcreates), which, among other things, engages in the business of  importing and selling programmable read-only memory microchips to China  Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (China Aerospace).  China  Aerospace is controlled by the PRC government and plays a substantial role in  the research, design, development and production of strategic and tactical  missile systems and launch vehicles for the PRC.\\r\\n             Since  1990, the U.S. government has maintained an arms embargo against the PRC that  prohibits the export, re-export, or re-transfer of any defense article to the  PRC. Prohibited defense articles are placed on the United States Munitions  List, which includes spacecraft systems and associated equipment. A programmable  read-only memory microchip (PROM) serves to store the initial start-up program  for a computer system and is built to withstand the conditions present in outer  space. \\r\\n             According  to their guilty pleas, Xian and Li admitted that they neither applied for nor  received a license from the United States to export defense articles of any  description; however, from April 2009 to Sept. 1, 2010, the two contacted a  company in the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking to export thousands of  radiation-hardened PROMs from that company.  Xian and Li knew a license  was required, but did not seek to obtain one because it would have required  them to identify the end user a their PRC-controlled customer, China Aerospace  a and describe the end use that would occur on behalf of the PRC.  To  avoid drawing attention to the true purpose of their orders, the defendants  conspired to break up orders into multiple shipments and designate countries  outside the PRC for delivery.  \\r\\n            On Sept. 1, 2010, the defendants were arrested in Hungary pursuant to a  United States provisional arrest warrant and transferred into the custody of  U.S. Marshals on April 1, 2011, after they waived extradition. In sentencing  the defendants, Judge Lee expressly stated that he had already taken into  account the time the defendants had spent in jail in Hungary, and that those  seven months would not reduce the sentence imposed today. Effectively, then,  the defendantsa sentence was 31 months in prison.\\r\\n          This case was investigated by ICE  HSI and DCIS, with assistance from ICE HSI Office of International Affairs,  Department of Justiceas Office of International Affairs, and the Department of  Defense, Defense Security Service.  Assistant United States Attorney James  P. Gillis of the Officeas National Security and International Crime Unit and  Trial Attorney Brandon L. Van Grack of the Justice Departmentas National  Security Division are prosecuting the case on behalf of the United States.\\r\\n           A copy of this press release may be found on the website of the United States  Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia at http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae.
