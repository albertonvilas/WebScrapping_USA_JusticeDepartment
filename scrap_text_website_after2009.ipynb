It\\'s very real, and it\\'s part of a coordinated campaign by the Chinese government, which the China Initiative is helping to disrupt,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.  \"The FBI opens a new China-related counterintelligence case nearly every 10 hours and we\\'ll continue our aggressive efforts to counter China\\'s criminal activity.\"', 'Established in November 2018, the Initiative identified a number of goals for the Department, ranging from increased focus on the investigation and prosecution of trade secret theft and economic espionage, to better countering threats posed by Chinese foreign investment and supply chain vulnerabilities. ', 'Prioritize investigations of economic espionage and trade secret theft', \"The Initiative prioritizes use of the Department's core tool, criminal investigation and prosecution, to counter economic espionage and other forms of trade secret theft.  In the past year, the Department charged three economic espionage cases (in which the trade secret theft was intended to benefit the Chinese government), bringing the total to five since the China Initiative was first announced.  Overall, since the Initiative was announced, we have charged more than 10 cases in which the trade secret theft had some alleged nexus to China, and we obtained guilty pleas of three defendants in those cases over the past year.\", 'To take one example, the Department announced the China Initiative on the same day that it unsealed criminal charges against United Microelectronics (UMC), the Chinese state-owned enterprise Fujian Jinhua, and several individual defendants, for economic espionage that victimized Micron Technology, Inc., a leading U.S. semiconductor company. ', '\"The United Microelectronics case is a glaring example of the PRC\\'s \\'rob, replicate, and replace\\' strategy, in which it robs a U.S. institution of its intellectual capital, replicates the stolen technology, and then endeavors to replace the U.S. institution on the Chinese and then the global market,\" said John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  \"Thanks to the dedication and diligence of prosecutors and FBI agents, UMC pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret theft and agreed to pay a fine of $60 million, the second largest fine in a trade secret case, and to cooperate in the pending prosecution of its co-defendants.\"', \"The National Counterintelligence Task Force, co-led by the FBI, launched its first major campaign in 2020, devoted to protecting U.S. technology and research from the Chinese government and its proxies.  This is a further step in the FBI's and Department's efforts to enlist all appropriate partners in ensuring integrity in government-funded programs and defeating economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.\", 'Develop an enforcement strategy for non-traditional collectors', 'At the outset, the Department identified academia as one of our most vulnerable sectors, because its traditions of openness, and the importance of international exchanges to the free flow of ideas, leave it vulnerable to PRC exploitation.  The Department has pursued a two-pronged strategy of raising awareness on campuses of the threats posed by China (and the importance of implementing a security program to detect them) and prosecuting researchers who have deliberately deceived authorities about their ties to China, which deprives institutions of the ability to screen for conflicts of interest and commitment, or otherwise exploited their access.', \"For example, the PRC has used talent programs to encourage the transfer of technical expertise from the United States, and elsewhere in the world, to benefit the PRC's economic and military development.  Talent recruits generally sign contracts with the PRC sponsor-entity that obligate them to produce scientific outputs; to publish the results of their work in the name of the PRC beneficiary; to allow the PRC beneficiary to assert intellectual property rights over their outputs; and to recruit other researchers into the programs, among other obligations.  \", 'In exchange, the talent recruits may receive lucrative compensation packages, prestigious titles, and custom-built laboratories. ', '\"While membership in these talent programs is not per se illegal, and the research itself may not always be protected as a trade secret, we know the PRC uses these plans, such as the well-known Thousand Talents Program, as a vehicle to recruit individuals with access to U.S. government-funded research to work in the interest of the Chinese Communist Party,\" said Adam S. Hickey, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, National Security Division. ', 'The Initiative brings together resources from across the Department, including the National Security, Criminal, Tax, and the Civil Divisions to address this unique challenge fairly and effectively.  In the past year, Department prosecutors have brought fraud, false statements, tax, smuggling and other charges against ten academics affiliated with research institutions across the country.  To date, prosecutors have obtained convictions in three of those cases. ', \"This year, the FBI and Department prosecutors also exposed six individuals, studying in the United States, found to be connected to People's Liberation Army military institutes, who concealed their affiliations from the State Department when applying for research visas to study at U.S. universities.  In one of those cases, the Department alleged that a PLA officer was being tasked by superiors in the PRC to obtain information that would benefit PLA operations.  In another case, a PLA medical researcher stands accused of following orders to observe lab operations at a U.S. university, which received funding from the U.S. government, in order to replicate those operations in the PRC. \", \"In each of the cases, the defendants are accused of concealing their PLA affiliations in order to obtain visas that allowed them to travel to the United States.  After the FBI conducted interviews this summer that led to charges in those cases and the State Department closed the PRC's Houston Consulate, a large number of undeclared, PLA-affiliated Chinese researchers fled the United States.\", 'Those six examples are just part of the interagency effort to protect academia and taxpayer-funded research.  The FBI and Department have been collaborating with federal grant-making agencies, the Joint Committee on the Research Environment, the major academic associations, the Academic Security and Counter Exploitation working group, and other appropriate entities, as well as hundreds of individual universities nationwide. ', 'Counter malicious cyber activity', \"The Department continues to expose and disrupt efforts by the PRC government to steal our intellectual property and our personally identifiable information (PII) through computer intrusions.  During the past year, we charged hackers working for the People's Liberation Army with the 2017 Equifax intrusion and others associated with the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in relation to global computer intrusion campaigns targeting biomedical companies conducting COVID-19-related research, engineering firms, and software makers.  One such MSS case resulted in the arrest of two conspirators in Malaysia.  Two of these cases highlighted China's development into a safe harbor for criminal hackers who also work for the PRC.  The Department disrupted these cyber threats in coordination with the private sector, using legal process to seize control of hacking infrastructure while the private sector removed other infrastructure from their platforms. \", \"In May, the FBI, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also issued a public announcement to raise awareness of the threat to COVID-19 research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and offer advice on better protecting that research from thefts.\", 'Counter malign foreign influence', 'The Department has used the Foreign Agents Registration Act (\"FARA\"), which requires those acting to influence public policy and opinion on behalf of a foreign individual or entity, to improve transparency and expose China\\'s foreign influence efforts.  Over the past year, the Department opened a record number of FARA investigations overall and doubled the number of new registrants and new foreign principals registering annually as of 2016.  That includes obtaining a record number of registrations from Chinese media companies.  The Department also notified a registered Chinese media company that its filings were deficient because they failed to fully disclose its activity in the United States and failed to properly label its informational materials.  The media entity remedied those deficiencies shortly thereafter. ', 'Through its outreach efforts to universities, the Department has highlighted the need to protect foreign students studying in the United States from coercive efforts by the Communist Party to censor the freedom of thought and expression that all students here should enjoy.', \"In late 2019, the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force formally established a new unit devoted specifically to understanding and defeating the malign foreign influence threat from the Chinese government and its proxies.\", 'Counter foreign intelligence activities', \"The Department has achieved a number of successes in the last year in countering China's foreign intelligence activities.  China has been targeting former members of the U.S. intelligence community for recruitment, and the Department has been holding accountable individuals who succumb to their efforts.  In November 2019, a former CIA case officer was sentenced to 19 years in prison for conspiring to deliver national defense information to the PRC.  In August 2020, another former CIA officer who had been tasked by the PRC was arrested on the same charge -- the fourth former intelligence officer charged in the last three years for similar conduct. \", 'The Department is particularly focused on disrupting the PRC government from using career networking and social media sites to target Americans, as well as holding those accountable who hide behind fake profiles to co-opt individuals on behalf of the PRC.  As one part of this effort, the FBI, in partnership with the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, created an educational film, \"The Nevernight Connection,\" which was released online in September 2020 to educate the public about the Chinese intelligence services\\' use of social media to spot and recruit persons of interest, especially current or former security clearance holders.', 'In March 2020, Xuehua (Edward) Peng was sentenced to 48 months in prison, and ordered to pay a $30,000 fine, for acting as an agent of the PRC\\'s Ministry of State Security (MSS) in connection with a scheme to conduct pickups known as \"dead drops\" and transport Secure Digital cards containing classified information from a source in the United States to the MSS operatives in China. ', 'In October 2020, Jun Wei Yeo was sentenced to 14 months in prison for acting within the United States as an agent of the MSS recruiting Americans, including U.S. military and government employees with high-level clearances. Yeo concealed his MSS affiliation from his American targets and used career networking sites and a false consulting firm to lure them to write papers which he ultimately passed to his MSS handlers.', 'In October 2020, eight defendants were charged with conspiring to act in the United States as illegal agents of the PRC, six of whom also face related charges of conspiring to commit interstate and international stalking.  According to the complaint, the defendants participated in an international campaign to threaten, harass, surveil and intimidate a resident of New Jersey and his family in order to force them to return to the PRC as part of an international effort by the PRC government known as \"Operation Fox Hunt\" and \"Operation Skynet.\"', 'In furtherance of the operation, the PRC government targets Chinese individuals living in foreign countries that the PRC government alleges have committed crimes under PRC law and seeks to repatriate them to the PRC to face charges, rather than rely upon proper forms of international law enforcement cooperation.', 'Foreign investment reviews and telecommunications security ', 'Beyond criminal enforcement, the Department worked to protect our national assets from national security risks posed by entities, subject to PRC influence, that seek to invest in U.S. companies or integrate into our supply chains. ', 'In April, the Department assumed the permanent chair of the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector, established by the President through Executive Order (EO), in 2020.  This organization, also known as \"Team Telecom,\" is an interagency group that reviews telecommunications, submarine cable landing, wireless, broadcast license, and other applications referred by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to identify and address risks to national security and law enforcement.  In the first 90 days after the Executive Order, the Department led Team Telecom to resolve more than half of the cases then pending review.', 'Team Telecom recommended that the FCC revoke and terminate the international telecommunications licenses held by the U.S. subsidiary of a PRC state-owned telecommunications company, China Telecom, the first revocation ever recommended by Team Telecom on national security grounds.  Team Telecom also recommended that the FCC partially deny a submarine cable application, to the extent it sought a direct connection between the United States and Hong Kong. ', \"Following the President's 2019 Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain, the Department has worked with the Commerce Department to develop regulations implementing the EO and has identified vulnerable areas of critical infrastructure that are ripe for investigation under the EO.\", \"The Department also worked to implement the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), which improved the authorities of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  During the previous year, the Department co-led a record number of significant CFIUS matters, on an annualized basis, including the investigation of the acquisition of a U.S. hotel management software company by a Chinese company, which the President prohibited, for just the sixth time in CFIUS history.  Under FIRRMA, the FBI continued to provide analytical assistance to support CFIUS's decision-making and identify high-risk non-notified transactions.\", 'With its increased resources, NSD has played a significant role in CFIUS enforcement, leading the Committee to assess just the second penalty in its history, for failing to secure sensitive personal data in violation of a 2018 interim CFIUS order.  NSD also dedicated personnel to identify transactions of concern that were not voluntarily filed with CFIUS and developed a program to identify bankruptcy cases that could implicate national security concerns.  The bankruptcy program helps to protect U.S. assets from predatory acquisitions, including PRC acquisitions that could impact our national security, which is particularly important in light of the economic impact of COVID-19.', 'Education and outreach', \"The success of the China Initiative is not measured by criminal cases and administrative actions alone, however.  Outreach to businesses and academia is critical to helping America's national assets better protect themselves.  For that reason, the Department disseminated outreach presentations for use by U.S. Attorneys in their Districts, which have been deployed at various events.  The FBI sustained its engagement with the private sector through various programs, and it developed and disseminated an innovative Academia Field Guide to support focused outreach by its academic outreach coordinators in all 56 field offices.  In the coming year, the Department, through the FBI and U.S. Attorneys' Offices, will continue to expand our partnerships outside the federal government, because the support of the American people is critical to our success.  All of our efforts are on their behalf.     \", \"The Attorney General commends the professionals throughout the Department, including those who work at Main Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorney's Offices around the country, who are committed to meeting the goals of the China Initiative and encourage them to redouble their efforts in the upcoming year. \", 'All defendants, in the cases mentioned herein, are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.']\n",

      "['The Department of Justice today announced that United Microelectronics Corporation, Inc. (UMC), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry, pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret theft and was sentenced to pay a $60 million fine, in exchange for its agreement to cooperate with the government in the investigation and prosecution of its co-defendant, a Chinese state-owned-enterprise.', \"A federal grand jury had indicted UMC in September 2018, along with Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd. (Fujian Jinhua), a state-owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and three individuals for conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess stolen trade secrets of an American semiconductor company (Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron)) for the benefit of a state-owned enterprise of the PRC (Fujian Jinhua).  As a result of today's guilty plea, and in accordance with an accompanying plea agreement, UMC, whose American Depository Receipts are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, will pay the fine--the second largest ever in a criminal trade secret prosecution, be subject to a three-year term of probation, and cooperate with the United States.\", '\"UMC stole the trade secrets of an American leader in computer memory to enable China to achieve a strategic priority: self-sufficiency in computer memory production without spending its own time or money to earn it,\" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen. \"This prosecution is an example of the Department of Justice\\'s successful efforts to defend American companies from those who try to cheat and steal their technology.\"', 'UMC pleaded guilty to a superseding information charging the company with one count of criminal trade secret theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. SS 1832(a)(3). The other criminal charges and a parallel civil suit by the United States against UMC will be dismissed. The criminal prosecution of Fujian Jinhua and the three individual defendants will continue, as will a civil action seeking to enjoin Fujian Jinhua from the further transfer of stolen trade secrets and the export to the United States of products manufactured by Fujian Jinhua that were made using the stolen trade secrets.', '\"UMC\\'s guilty plea points this case towards trial against Fujian Jinhua in 2021,\" said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson.  \"Criminal trade secrets cases protect freedom and innovation.  These cases have global significance when a foreign defendant is charged with stealing intellectual property protected by U.S. law.\"', '\"Protecting American intellectual property and trade secrets is a top priority for the FBI.  This is especially true for the FBI\\'s San Francisco Division, with Silicon Valley in our area of responsibility, and we will continue to lead the fight in safeguarding U.S. innovation from foreign adversaries,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig Fair.  \"This case sends an important message to Bay Area companies: if you report suspicious activity to the FBI, we will follow all investigative leads to identify and prosecute those responsible.\"', 'According to the facts admitted in connection with the guilty plea, UMC hired the three individual defendants--Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang--from Micron\\'s Taiwan subsidiary. UMC made Chen a senior vice president and assigned him to lead negotiation of an agreement with Fujian Jinhua to develop Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) technology for Fujian Jinhua. As a foundry company, UMC previously made logic chips designed by other companies but did not make DRAM memory chips. Chen hired Ho and Wang to join the DRAM development team, and Ho and Wang brought Micron\\'s confidential information to UMC from Micron\\'s Taiwan subsidiary. After UMC\\'s Information Technology Department found Micron\\'s intellectual property on Ho\\'s UMC computer, Chen approved the issuance of two \"off network\" laptop computers that allowed UMC employees to access Micron confidential information without further detection by UMC\\'s IT department. In particular, Wang used one file containing Micron\\'s trade secrets to adjust UMC\\'s design rules for the memory in question. Later, when Taiwan authorities searched UMC\\'s offices, Ho and Wang asked another UMC employee to hide papers, notes, USB drives, a personal phone, and a laptop computer while the Taiwan authorities executed their search warrants. Taiwan authorities recovered only one of the two off-network laptops. The hard drive of the other was reformatted and concealed from Taiwan authorities. Beginning in the month of the Taiwan raids, Chen became president of Fujian Jinhua and took charge of its memory production facility.', \"This prosecution is a result of an investigation by the FBI. Substantial assistance was provided by Taiwan's Ministry of Justice, its Ministry of Justice Investigation's Bureau (MJIB), and the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office (TDPO).\"]\n",

      "[\"Two leaders of one of the world's most notorious videogame piracy groups, Team Xecuter, have been arrested and are in custody facing charges filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle.\", 'Max Louarn, 48, a French national of Avignon, France, Yuanning Chen, 35, a Chinese national of Shenzhen, China, and Gary Bowser, 51, a Canadian national of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, were charged in a federal indictment unsealed today.  The indictment alleges the defendants were leaders of a criminal enterprise that developed and sold illegal devices that hacked popular videogame consoles so they could be used to play unauthorized, or pirated, copies of videogames.  The enterprise targeted popular consoles such as the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo 3DS, the Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Edition, the Sony PlayStation Classic, and the Microsoft Xbox.', '\"These defendants were allegedly leaders of a notorious international criminal group that reaped illegal profits for years by pirating video game technology of U.S. companies,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department\\'s Criminal Division.  \"These arrests show that the department will hold accountable hackers who seek to commandeer and exploit the intellectual property of American companies for financial gain, no matter where they may be located.\"', '\"These defendants lined their pockets by stealing and selling the work of other video-game developers - even going so far as to make customers pay a licensing fee to play stolen games,\" said U.S. Attorney Brian Moran for the Western District of Washington.  \"This conduct doesn\\'t just harm billion dollar companies, it hijacks the hard work of individuals working to advance in the video-game industry.\"', '\"Theft of intellectual property hurts U.S. industry, game developers and exploits legitimate gaming customers, all of which threaten the legitimacy of the commercial video game industry,\" said Acting Special Agent in Charge Eben Roberts of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\\'s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Seattle.  \"We are committed to working with our international partners to find criminals like these who steal copyrighted material and bring cyber criminals to justice.\"', '\"Imagine if something you invented was stolen from you and then marketed and sold to customers around the world. That is exactly what Team Xecuter was doing,\" said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\\'s Seattle Field Office.  \"This is a perfect example of why the FBI has made the prevention of the theft of intellectual property a priority. These arrests should send a message to would-be pirates that the FBI does not consider these crimes to be a game.\"', \"According to court documents, the Team Xecuter criminal enterprise is comprised of over a dozen individual members located around the world.  These members include developers who exploit vulnerabilities in videogame consoles and design circumvention devices; website designers who create the various websites that promote the enterprise's devices; suppliers who manufacture the devices; and resellers around the world who sell and distribute the devices. \", 'The indictment alleges that due to the illegal nature of its business, Team Xecuter continuously sought to evade enforcement efforts by victim companies, financial institutions, and law enforcement.  Notably, Team Xecuter attempted to protect its overall business by using a wide variety of brands, websites, and distribution channels, according to the indictment.  From approximately June 2013 through August 2020, Team Xecuter used a variety of product names for its devices, such as the Gateway 3DS, the Stargate, the TrueBlue Mini, the Classic2Magic, and the SX line of devices that included the SX OS, the SX Pro, the SX Lite, and the SX Core.  ', 'According to the indictment, Team Xecuter at times cloaked its illegal activity with a purported desire to support gaming enthusiasts who wanted to design their own videogames for noncommercial use.  However, the overwhelming demand and use for the enterprise\\'s devices was to play pirated videogames.  To support this illegal activity, Team Xecuter allegedly helped create and support online libraries of pirated videogames for its customers, and several of the enterprise\\'s devices came preloaded with numerous pirated videogames.  According to the indictment, Team Xecuter was so brazen that it even required customers to purchase a \"license\" to unlock the full features of its custom firmware, the SX OS, in order to enable the ability to play pirated videogames.

The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities the defendants identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran.  In addition to the theft of highly protected and sensitive data, the defendants also vandalized websites, often under the pseudonym \"Sejeal\" and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\\'s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.', \"To select their victims, the defendants conducted online reconnaissance, including gathering public data and intelligence to determine a victim's areas of expertise, and using vulnerability scanning tools and other means to assess computer networks.  The defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.\", 'The defendants then used key-loggers and \"remote access Trojans\" to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks.

      "['Remarks as Prepared for Delivery', 'Good morning.  With me today are FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin and Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\\'s Washington DC Field Office James Dawson.  We are here to announce coordinated, wide-ranging actions to disrupt the malicious cyber activities of a group commonly referred to as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)-41, as well as a related international criminal enterprise involving APT-41 actors.  Cybersecurity experts have referred to APT-41\\'s activities as \"one of the broadest campaigns by a Chinese cyber espionage actor [] in recent years.\"', 'We are announcing today multiple efforts to disrupt these activities.  First and foremost is that we have unsealed three indictments that, collectively, charge five Chinese nationals with computer hacking and charge two Malaysian nationals for helping some of those hackers target victims and sell the fruits of their hacking.', 'Our charges allege two distinct categories of criminal conduct:', 'First, as the core of APT-41\\'s computer hacking, the Chinese defendants targeted well over 100 victims worldwide in a variety of industries and sectors that are, sadly, part of the standard target list for Chinese hackers.  These criminal acts were turbo-charged by a sophisticated technique referred to as a \"supply chain attack,\" in which the Chinese hackers compromised software providers around the world, and modified the providers\\' code to install backdoors that enabled further hacks against the software providers\\' customers. ', 'Second, and as an additional method of making money, several of the Chinese defendants compromised the networks of video game companies worldwide (a billion-dollar industry) and defrauded them of in-game resources.  Two of the Chinese defendants stand accused, with two Malaysian defendants, of selling those resources on the black market, through their illicit web site. ', 'Now, in addition to these unsealed indictments, I am pleased to announce that, through the cooperation of Malaysian law enforcement authorities, the two Malaysian defendants were arrested on Sunday evening and now face extradition proceedings.', 'Identifying those responsible and holding them to account is our primary mission, but criminal investigation and prosecution alone are not enough to make the Internet safer. ', \"So there is a third part of today's announcement.  Specifically, in addition to these criminal charges, and the two arrests, the Department of Justice and the FBI have been working with seven private sector partners, including Microsoft Corporation, Google, Facebook, and Verizon Media, to identify and neutralize the computer infrastructure that APT-41 uses to conduct its crimes: its virtual private servers, malware, malicious domains, and other tools.  We have done this through a combination of public and private actions, including technical measures to block this threat actor from accessing victims' computer systems, issuing a public safety announcement outlining their tactics, techniques, and procedures (to aid network defenders), and by taking control of, or otherwise disabling, their accounts pursuant to court orders or terms of service violations.\", \"The bottom line is that we have used every tool at the department's disposal to disrupt these APT-41 activities.\", 'Ideally, I would be thanking Chinese law enforcement authorities for their cooperation in this matter and the five Chinese hackers would now be in custody awaiting trial.  Unfortunately, the record of recent years tells us that the Chinese Communist Party has a demonstrated history of choosing a different path, that of making China safe for their own cyber criminals, so long as they help with its goals of stealing intellectual property and stifling freedom. ', 'Less than two months ago, Assistant Attorney General Demers was at this podium to announce an indictment in another hacking case in which the Chinese government tolerated the defendants\\' criminal activity because those defendants were willing to work on behalf of the Chinese intelligence services.  And here we are again.  In this case, one of the Chinese defendants is accused of boasting to a colleague that he was \"very close\" to the Ministry of State Security and would be protected \"unless something very big happens.\"  The hacker and his associate agreed not to \"touch domestic stuff anymore.\"', 'We know the Chinese authorities to be at least as able as the law enforcement authorities here and in like-minded states to enforce laws against computer intrusions.  But they choose not to. ', 'But know this: no country can be respected as a global leader while paying only lip service to the rule of law and without taking steps to disrupt brazen criminal acts like these.  No responsible government knowingly shelters cyber criminals that target victims worldwide in acts of rank theft. ', 'Responsible nations not only condemn criminal conduct, they root it out and punish it.', 'Responsible nations disavow criminals within their borders and bring them to justice.', \"Responsible nations work with other countries' law enforcement authorities and ensure that justice is served in a court of law.\", 'The PRC has done none of these things. ', 'You can take three additional observations from this press conference today.  First, the Chinese government has the power to help stop crimes like these.', 'Second, the Chinese Government has made a deliberate choice to allow its citizens to commit computer intrusions and attacks around the world because these actors will also help the PRC. ', 'But, third, the Department of Justice will do everything it can to disrupt these crimes by exposing the techniques, tactics, and procedures used by APT-41, enabling the private sector to disable them, and working with our law enforcement colleagues around the world to arrest the hackers when we can. ', 'We appreciate our partnerships with the private sector, such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Verizon Media, and foreign law enforcement partners who have been a force multiplier in the fight against these international criminals.  Such partnerships send a clear message that governments and the private sector are prepared to work together to defend against significant cyber threats.', \"Today, on top of all the measures I've mentioned already, we are exposing this threat to the international community, to cybersecurity experts, and to the greater public, and we will never stop pursuing the individuals responsible for these alleged criminal acts, here and abroad, and anywhere they travel.\", 'Now, I will turn the podium over to Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin, who will discuss the allegations in the indictments in greater detail.']\n",

      "[\"In August 2019 and August 2020, a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., returned two separate indictments charging five computer hackers, all of whom were residents and nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC), with computer intrusions affecting over 100 victim companies in the United States and abroad, including software development companies, computer hardware manufacturers, telecommunications providers, social media companies, video game companies, non-profit organizations, universities, think tanks, and foreign governments, as well as pro-democracy politicians and activists in Hong Kong.\", ' The intrusions, which security researchers have tracked using the threat labels \"APT41,\" \"Barium,\" \"Winnti,\" \"Wicked Panda,\" and \"Wicked Spider,\" facilitated the theft of source code, software code signing certificates, customer account data, and valuable business information.  These intrusions also facilitated the defendants\\' other criminal schemes, including ransomware and \"crypto-jacking\" schemes, the latter of which refers to the group\\'s unauthorized use of victim computers to \"mine\" cryptocurrency. ', \"Also in August 2020, the same federal grand jury returned a third indictment charging two Malaysian businessmen who conspired with two of the Chinese hackers to profit from computer intrusions targeting the video game industry in the United States and abroad.  Shortly thereafter, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued arrest warrants for the two businessmen.  On Sept. 14, 2020, pursuant to a provisional arrest request from the United States with a view to their extradition, Malaysian authorities arrested them in Sitiawan.  The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the Government of Malaysia, including the Attorney General's Chambers of Malaysia and the Royal Malaysia Police.\", 'In addition to arrest warrants for all of the charged defendants, in September 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued seizure warrants that resulted in the recent seizure of hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names, and command-and-control (C2\") \"dead drop\" web pages used by the defendants to conduct their computer intrusion offenses.  The FBI executed the warrants in coordination with other actions by several private-sector companies, which included disabling numerous accounts for violations of the companies\\' terms of service.  In addition, in partnership with the department, Microsoft developed and implemented technical measures to block this threat actor from accessing victims\\' computer systems.  The actions by Microsoft were a significant part of the overall effort to deny the defendants continued access to hacking infrastructure, tools, accounts, and command and control domain names.  In coordination with today\\'s announcement, the FBI has also released a Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report that contains critical, relevant technical information collected by the FBI for use by specific private-sector partners.', '\"The department of Justice has used every tool available to disrupt the illegal computer intrusions and cyberattacks by these Chinese citizens,\" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen.  \"Regrettably, the Chinese communist party has chosen a different path of making China safe for cybercriminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal intellectual property helpful to China.\"', ' \"Today\\'s charges, the related arrests, seizures of malware and other infrastructure used to conduct intrusions, and coordinated private sector protective actions reveal yet again the department\\'s determination to use all of the tools at its disposal and to collaborate with the private sector and nations who support the rule of law in cyberspace,\" said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers.  \"This is the only way to neutralize malicious nation state cyber activity.\"', '\"Today\\'s announcement demonstrates the ramifications faced by the hackers in China but it is also a reminder to those who continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics that we will utilize every tool we have to administer justice,\" said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \"The arrests in Malaysia are a direct result of partnership, cooperation and collaboration. As the cyber threat continues to evolve larger than any one agency can address, the FBI remains committed to being an indispensable partner to our federal, international and private sector partners to stop rampant cyber crime and hold those carrying out these kind of actions accountable.\"', '\"The scope and sophistication of the crimes in these unsealed indictments is unprecedented. The alleged criminal scheme used actors in China and Malaysia to illegally hack, intrude and steal information from victims worldwide,\" said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.  \"As set forth in the charging documents, some of these criminal actors believed their association with the PRC provided them free license to hack and steal across the globe.  This scheme also contained a new and troubling cyber-criminal component - the targeting and utilization of gaming platforms to both defraud video game companies and launder illicit proceeds.\"', '\"The actions announced today reflect a years-long commitment by the FBI Washington Field Office to pursue the perpetrators of the computer intrusion campaigns described in the indictments, and to bring those perpetrators to justice,\" said Acting Assistant Director in Charge James A. Dawson, FBI Washington Field Office. \"This case demonstrates the FBI\\'s dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter where they are, and to whom they may be connected.\" ', 'The August 2019 indictment charged Zhang Haoran (Zhang Hao Ran ), 35, and Tan Dailin (Tan Dai Lin ), 35, with 25 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, money laundering, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\").  The indictment charged Zhang and Tan with participating in a \"Computer Hacking Conspiracy,\" which targeted high-technology and similar organizations.  The indictment also charged that, as an additional way to make money, Zhang and Tan participated in a \"Video Game Conspiracy,\" through which Zhang and Tan, together with others, sought to make money by hacking video game companies, obtaining and otherwise generating digital items of value (e.g., video game currency), and then selling such items for profit.  In several instances, they used their unauthorized access to gaming company networks take action against other unrelated groups engaged in the same fraudulent generation of gaming artifacts, thereby attempting to eliminate the criminal competition.', 'One of the August 2020, indictments charged Jiang Lizhi (Jiang Li Zhi ), 35, Qian Chuan (Qian Chuan ), 39, and Fu Qiang (Fu Qiang ), 37, with nine counts of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to violate the CFAA, substantive violations of the CFAA, access device fraud, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering.  The racketeering conspiracy pertained to the three defendants\\' conducting the affairs of Chengdu 404 Network Technology (\"Chengdu 404\"), a PRC company, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses affecting over 100 victim companies, organizations, and individuals in the United States and around the world, including in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.  The defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India and Vietnam, and targeted, but did not compromise, government computer networks in the United Kingdom.  In one notable instance, the defendants conducted a ransomware attack on the network of a non-profit organization dedicated to combating global poverty.', 'The defendants associated with Chengdu 404 employed sophisticated hacking techniques to gain and maintain access to victim computer networks.  One example was the defendants\\' use of \"supply chain attacks,\" in which the hackers compromised software providers and then modified the providers\\' code to facilitate further intrusions against the software providers\\' customers.  Another example was the hackers\\' use of C2 \"dead drops,\" which are seemingly legitimate web pages that the hackers created, but which were surreptitiously encoded instructions to their malware.  However, they also employed publicly available exploits and tools, including the following common vulnerabilities and exposures (\"CVE\"):  CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-16920, CVE-2019-16278, CVE-2019-1652/CVE-2019-1653, and CVE-2020-10189.', \"The second August 2020 indictment charged Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32, both Malaysian nationals and residents, with 23 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, money laundering, violations of the CFAA, and falsely registering domain names.  The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling conducted the affairs of Sea Gamer Mall, a Malaysian company founded by Wong, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses targeting the video game industry in the United States, France, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.  The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling worked with various hackers, including Zhang and Tan, to profit from the hackers' criminal computer intrusions at video game companies. \", 'The indictment against Zhang and Tan charges the defendants with two counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; five counts of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; nine counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; four counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.', 'The indictment against Jiang, Qian, and Fu charges the defendants with one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.', 'The indictment against Wong and Ling charges the defendants with one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of racketeering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; three counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; five counts of furthering fraud by unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; two counts of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and three counts of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

      "[\"Today, the Justice Department unsealed charges in a significant national security cyber matter.  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington (EDWA) and the National Security Division (NSD) have charged two Chinese hackers working with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), including the Guangdong State Security Department (GSSD) of the MSS, with a sweeping global computer intrusion campaign.  In making this announcement, I'm joined here by Dave Bowdich, Deputy Director of the FBI, Bill Hyslop, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington, and Raymond Duda, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Seattle Field Division.  \", 'The campaign targeted intellectual property and confidential business information held by the private sector, including COVID-19-related treatment, testing, and vaccines.  The hackers also targeted the online accounts of non-governmental organizations and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States, China, Hong Kong, and abroad.  Targeted industries included high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense.  According to the indictment, these malicious cyber activities began more than ten years ago and were ongoing as of the date of the indictment.  During that time, the hackers stole terabytes of data from hundreds of targets, establishing themselves as a prolific threat to U.S. and foreign networks. ', 'The activities outlined in the indictment are concrete examples of two concerning trends: first, and one we\\'ve seen for some time, China is using cyber-enabled theft as part of a global campaign to \"rob, replicate, and replace\" non-Chinese companies in the global marketplace, and second, and one that is perhaps less appreciated by the public and international partners, China is providing a safe haven for criminals who, as in this case, are hacking in part for their own personal profit but willing to help the state.', 'As the indictment shows, the hackers targeted technology companies in countries with high technology industries, including in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  These intrusions are yet another example of China\\'s brazen willingness to engage in theft through computer intrusions contrary to their international commitments - such as their 2015 understanding with the United States, and similar understandings with other countries, not to \"conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information,\"[1] with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.', 'Unsurprisingly, the intrusions targeted industries outlined in \"Made in China 2025\" - China\\'s ten-year plan for targeting strategic advanced technology manufacturing industries for development.  While the plan calls for an innovation-driven approach, cases like this one[2] show it is as much a roadmap to theft as it is guidance to innovate.  The intrusions in this case targeted 8 of the 10 technology sectors identified in the plan: next generation information technology, robotics and automated machine tools, aircraft and aircraft components, maritime vessels and marine engineering equipment, clean energy vehicles, new materials, biotechnology, and advanced rail.', 'The indictment specifically outlines how stealing intellectual property from companies in these high-tech industries could help Chinese companies replicate the targeted technology and eventually edge out their non-Chinese competitors.  ', 'For example, from one target, a Maryland technology and manufacturing firm, the defendants obtained competitive business intelligence, in the form of testing mechanisms and results, product composition, manufacturing processes, and supply chain data that would have revealed to competitors what products the firm was intending to bring to the market.  The same stolen information would have allowed competitors to save on research and development costs and time, thereby providing them a competitive edge in the global marketplace.  Similar concrete examples of stolen research and development data include a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company, which suffered the theft of the chemical structure of, and engineering processes for, anti-infective agents, and a California pharmaceutical company, which suffered the theft of the chemical structure of, and testing data for, the treatment for a common chronic disease.', 'The business context for some of these intrusions is also noteworthy.  For example, one target, a Massachusetts medical device engineering company saw the defendants steal source code and algorithms at or about the time it had sought to protect such data from a Chinese firm with which it had partnered to produce device components.', \"China's anti-competitive behavior and flagrant disregard for their promises not to engage in cyber-enabled intellectual property theft is not just a domestic issue; it is a global issue.  The indictment alleges activity against companies in at least 10 countries around the world.  The indictment shows very clearly that no country is immune.  Any country with a successful company or industry must be on guard and prepared to protect itself. \", \"The indictment also highlights how the Chinese government is willing to turn a blind eye to prolific criminal hackers operating within China's borders.  Although the indictment alleges that the defendants conducted activity on behalf of the MSS, some of the defendants' alleged criminal activities were conducted for personal profit.  For example, in one instance, Defendant LI is alleged to have e-mailed a target and threatened to expose the target's stolen source code on the internet unless he was paid $15,000 in cryptocurrency. \", 'In this manner, China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being \"on call\" to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party\\'s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\\' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research.  With the top cover provided by state officials, these criminals are given free rein to victimize law abiding citizens around the world.  All of these activities - state-sponsored theft of intellectual property and knowingly providing a safe havens for cyber criminals - run afoul of norms of acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, which the international community must address.', \"These charges reflect the Department's continued determination and ability to hold individuals and nations accountable for cyber-enabled crimes.  In addition to disrupting the activities of a group that was not being tracked as an organized threat by the private sector, we hope the indictment will raise broader awareness of China's malicious cyber activities.  \", 'We are grateful for the willingness of our international law enforcement partners to cooperate with us in the investigation and disruption of cyber threats.  This is yet another example of how like-minded countries can stand together to counter malicious state-sponsored cyber activities.', \"Before I turn this over to Dave Bowdich, I'd like to thank all the tremendous work done by the agents at the FBI's Spokane resident agency and San Antonio field office that led the investigation; the many FBI agents and professionals at FBI's Cyber Division, in Norfolk, and in Portland who provided essential assistance; the FBI Legal Attaches and Cyber Assistant Legal Attaches stationed around the world who led the coordination with our foreign partners; and the prosecutors both in Spokane and here in the National Security Division.\", '[1] White House, \"FACT SHEET: President Xi Jinping\\'s State Visit to the United States,\" September 25, 2015, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states.', '[2] See, e.g., Department of Justice, \"Two Chinese Hackers Associated with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaigns Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information,\" December 20, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion.']\n"

As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen.  The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government\\'s Ministry of State Security.  This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney\\'s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

This case demonstrates the FBI\\'s dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities,\" said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\\'s Seattle Division.', 'According to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs.  In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability.  The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications.  The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the \"China Chopper\" web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.', 'To conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\\' names and extensions (e.g., from \".rar\" to \".jpg\") and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\\' \"recycle bins.\"  The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft.  In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.', 'The indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures.

      "['VIDEO: Attorney General William P. Barr Delivers Remarks at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum ', \"Thank you very much, Andrew for your very kind introduction and I'd like to say that I really appreciate the work that Andrew and Matt, our U.S. Attorneys for the Eastern and Western District of Michigan our doing here for the people of Michigan and all the law enforcement community from Michigan, that is here today. We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you'll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum -- especially Elaine Didier -- for hosting this event.  I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso.  Even under normal circumstances, it's hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it's especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who've come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.\", \"I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S. Attorney here in the Western District, so John it's great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it's appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn't a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration. \", \"I'm privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party.  The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world.  It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship.  How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890's, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It's because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What's at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?\", 'Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O\\'Brien spoke about the CCP\\'s ideology and global ambitions.  He declared, and I agree, that \"the days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People\\'s Republic of China are over.\"  And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.  In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world.  Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I\\'ll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America\\'s reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.', 'At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China\\'s immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: \"If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people... this last impression - of the reality of China\\'s colossal potential - is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\" It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.', 'Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China\\'s remarkable rise had a famous motto: \"hide your strength and bide your time.\" That is precisely what China has done. China\\'s economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world\\'s GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China\\'s time has arrived.', 'The People\\'s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg--an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\\'s preeminent technological superpower.  A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party\\'s \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies.  Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership.  Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \"Made in China 2025\" sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications.  It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether. ', '\"Made in China 2025\" is the latest iteration of the PRC\\'s state-led, mercantilist economic model.  For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy.  To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\\'s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage.  About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China. ', \"The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific.  In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats. \", 'Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\\'s \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure initiative.  Although billed as \"foreign aid,\" in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\\'s strategic interests and domestic economic needs.  For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017.  This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.     ', 'Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\\'s plans to dominate the world\\'s digital infrastructure through its \"Digital Silk Road\" initiative.  I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\\'s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G.  Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\\'s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence.  Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go.  In 2017, Beijing unveiled its \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\" a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030.  Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.', 'The PRC\\'s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware.  According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.  \"Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\" in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.', 'The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials.  Overall, China is America\\'s top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports.  The risks of dependence are real.  In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea.  The PRC could do the same to us.  As China\\'s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\\'s predatory economic policies are succeeding.  For a hundred years, America was the world\\'s largest manufacturer -- allowing us to serve as the world\\'s \"arsenal of democracy.\"  China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010.  The PRC is now the world\\'s \"arsenal of dictatorship.\"', \"How did China accomplish all this?  No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people.  At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible.  China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade.  In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status.  In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations.  Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion. \", 'Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \"How America\\'s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\"  The article details how China\\'s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile.  The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies.  Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits.  Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.', \"Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services.  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency.  For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns.  In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers -- including American companies -- from exporting them to other countries that needed them.  It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.\", 'China\\'s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns.  It has become the United States\\' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China.  China\\'s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft.  As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \"creating their own competitors.\"', 'America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals.  America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\\'s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \"APIs.\"  As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \"[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\" it \"could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\"', 'To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\\'s rulers went to the same playbook they\\'ve used to gut other American industries.  In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \"high-value-added-industry\" and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.  Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies.  American firms face well-known obstacles in China\\'s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China.  And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies. ', 'In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers.  Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.', 'As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China\\'s rulers isn\\'t to trade with the United States.  It is to raid the United States.  If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards.  But in the end, the PRC\\'s goal is to replace you.  As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \"[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\"', \"Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed.  As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.  It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary.  The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.  \", 'If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough.  But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America.  As this Administration\\'s China Strategy recognizes, \"the CCP\\'s campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China\\'s borders.\"  Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.', 'All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence -- even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States.  Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion. ', \"Take Hollywood.  Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit.  And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice.  But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights.  This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.\", 'For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus.  The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China.  But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal.  The deal never materialized.', 'In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \"Ancient One,\" a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic.  When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \"if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\\'s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\"  Or, as the Chinese government might say, \"[w]e\\'re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\"', \"These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP.  National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks.  But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits.  Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them.  This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.    \", \"The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one.  In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office.  The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market -- both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime.  Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing.  In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier. \", 'But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood -- and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions.  To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi.  By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S. technology and know-how.  As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \"[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\"  Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.', 'Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC.  America\\'s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.  In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \"liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\"  Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China -- the world\\'s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.', 'Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.  For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests.  Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store.  Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud. ', \"Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.   During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones.  And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple.  Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones.  We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack.  Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities?  They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities.  And what we've asked for is a warrant - when we have a warrant from a court - that we should be able to get into because cellphones.  That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.\", 'The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence.  More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives -- efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. ', 'As China\\'s government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party.  Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\\'s request.  Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S. politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a \"friendly face\" on pro-regime policies.  The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner.  And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed. ', 'America\\'s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists.  You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \"guanxi\" -- or system of influential social networking -- necessary to do business with the PRC.  But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct.  But it does require those who are acting as the \"agents\" of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.', 'By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\\'t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States.  The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions.  For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \"Confucius Institutes,\" which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing.  Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\\'s demands.   ', \"In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions.  But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength. \", \"Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom.  A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.  There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.\", \"In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics.  During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films.  To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.\", 'I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.  When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC\\'s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.  Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn\\'t let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.  But that moment of courage wouldn\\'t last long.  After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access.  The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a \"stupid mistake.\"  Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai.  As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management.  Of the park\\'s full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party.  They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.', 'Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles.  Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. ', \"American companies must understand the stakes.  The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter's earnings report.  But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.\", 'During the Cold War, Lewis Powell -- later Justice Powell -- sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it.  \"[T]he time has come,\" he said, \"indeed, it is long overdue -- for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\"  So too today.  The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods.  And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. ', 'If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers.  As Justice Powell wrote: \"Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\"  Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action.  Following the recent imposition of the PRC\\'s draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data.  True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees.  We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm.  I hope they do.  If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party\\'s corrupt and dictatorial rule.      ', 'The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them.  To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy.  America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we -- the American people, the American government, and American business together -- can do it again.  Our freedom depends on it.  ']\n",

Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.    \", 'At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States.  Yet even then, there were signs of China\\'s immense latent power.  In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote:  \"If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people .... This last impression--of the reality of China\\'s colossal potential--is perhaps the most vivid of our journey.  As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\"[3]  It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass. ', 'Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China\\'s remarkable rise, had a famous motto: \"hide your strength and bide your time.\"[4]  That is precisely what China has done.  China\\'s economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world\\'s GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today.  By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours.  The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving \"closer to center stage,\" \"building a socialism that is superior to capitalism,\" and replacing the American Dream with the \"Chinese solution.\"[5]  China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time.  From the perspective of its communist rulers, China\\'s time has arrived.', 'The People\\'s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg--an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\\'s preeminent superpower.  A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party\\'s \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles.  Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership.  Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \"Made in China 2025\" sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications.  It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether. ', '\"Made in China 2025\" is the latest iteration of the PRC\\'s state-led, mercantilist economic model.  For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy.  To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\\'s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage.  About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China. ', \"The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific.  In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats. \", 'Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\\'s \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure initiative.  Although billed as \"foreign aid,\" in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\\'s strategic interests and domestic economic needs.  For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017.  This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.     ', 'Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\\'s plans to dominate the world\\'s digital infrastructure through its \"Digital Silk Road\" initiative.  I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\\'s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G.  Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\\'s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence.  Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go.  AI long ago outmatched the world\\'s chess grandmasters.  But the PRC\\'s interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea.  The following year, Beijing unveiled its \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\" a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030.  Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.', 'The PRC\\'s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware.  According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6]  \"Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\" in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7] ', \"The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials.  Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports.  The risks of dependence are real.  In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea.  The PRC could do the same to us.\", 'As China\\'s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\\'s predatory economic policies are succeeding.  For a hundred years, America was the world\\'s largest manufacturer -- allowing us to serve as the world\\'s \"arsenal of democracy.\"  China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010.  The PRC is now the world\\'s \"arsenal of dictatorship.\"', \"How did China accomplish all this?  No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people.  At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible.  China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade.  In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status.  In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations.  Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion. \", 'Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \"How America\\'s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\"[8]  The article details how China\\'s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile.  The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies.  Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits.  Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.', \"Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services.  The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency.  For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns.  In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers -- including American companies -- from exporting them to countries in need.  It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.\", 'China\\'s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns.  It has become the United States\\' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China.  China\\'s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft.  As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \"creating their own competitors.\"[9] ', 'America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals.  America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\\'s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \"APIs.\"  As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \"[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\" it \"could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\"[10] ', 'To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\\'s rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries.  In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \"high-value-added-industry\" and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11]  Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies.  American firms face well-known obstacles in China\\'s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China.  And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies. ', 'In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers.  Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.', 'As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China\\'s rulers isn\\'t to trade with the United States.  It is to raid the United States.  If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards.  But in the end, the PRC\\'s goal is to replace you.  As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \"[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\"[12]', \"Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed.  As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.  It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary.  The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.  \", 'If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough.  But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America.  As this Administration\\'s China Strategy recognizes, \"the CCP\\'s campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China\\'s borders.\"[13]  Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.', 'All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence--even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States.  Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion. ', \"Take Hollywood.  Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit.  And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice.  But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights.  This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.\", 'For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus.  The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China.  (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.)  But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal.  The deal never materialized.', 'In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \"Ancient One,\" a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic.  When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \"if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\\'s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\"[14]  Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say \"[w]e\\'re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\"[15]', \"These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda.  National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks.  But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits.  Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them.  This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.    \", \"The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one.  In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office.  The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market--both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime.  Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing.  In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier. \", 'But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood--and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions.  To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi.  By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how.  As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \"[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\"[16]  Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.', \"Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC.  America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. \", 'In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \"liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\"[17]  Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China--the world\\'s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.', 'Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.  For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests.  Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store.  Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud. ', 'The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence.  More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives -- efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. ', 'As China\\'s government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party.  Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\\'s request.  Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a \"friendly face\" on pro-regime policies.  The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner.  And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed. ', 'America\\'s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists.  You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \"guanxi\" -- or system of influential social networks--necessary to do business with the PRC.  But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct.  But it does require those who are acting as the \"agents\" of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18] ', 'These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.', 'By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\\'t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations.  The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions.  For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \"Confucius Institutes,\" which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing.  Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\\'s demands.   ', \"In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions.  But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength. \", \"Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom.  A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.  \", 'There was a time American companies understood that.  They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.', \"In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics.  During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films.  To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.\", \"I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.  When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.  Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.   \", 'But that moment of courage wouldn\\'t last long.  After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access.  The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a \"stupid mistake.\"[19]  Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai.  As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management.  Of the park\\'s 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party.  They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.', 'Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles.  Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. ', 'American companies must understand the stakes.  The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report.  But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.', 'During the Cold War, Lewis Powell -- later Justice Powell -- sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it.  \"[T]he time has come,\" he said, \"indeed, it is long overdue--for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\"[20]', 'So too today.  The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods.  And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. ', 'If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers.  As Justice Powell wrote: \"Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\"[21]  Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action.  Following the recent imposition of the PRC\\'s draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data.  True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees.  We will see if these companies hold firm.  I hope they do.  If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party\\'s corrupt and dictatorial rule.      ', 'The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them.  To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy.  America has done that before.  If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we--the American people, American government, and American business together--can do it again.  Our freedom depends on it.  ', '[1] Robert C.

      "['Hao Zhang, 41, of China, was found guilty of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses today, announced the Department of Justice.  The ruling was handed down by the Honorable Edward J. Davila, U.S. District Judge, following a four-day bench trial.', \"Evidence submitted during the course of the trial demonstrated that from 2010 to 2015, Zhang conspired to and did steal trade secrets from two companies: Avago, a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in semiconductor design and processing, headquartered in San Jose, California, and Singapore; and Skyworks, an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts.  Judge Davila found that Zhang intended to steal the trade secrets for the benefit of the People's Republic of China\", '\"The defendant plotted with Tianjin University to take trade secrets from two U.S. companies, including his own employer, to China for the benefit of the Chinese Government,\" said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.  \"Today\\'s guilty verdict on all counts is an important step in holding accountable an individual who robbed his U.S. employer of trade secrets and sought to replicate the company\\'s technology and replace its market share.  The Department of Justice\\'s commitment to prosecuting these cases should serve as a cautionary tale to anyone considering doing the same.\"        ', '\"A free nation is naturally innovative.  No nation is more innovative than the United States.  Countries without freedom cannot match our innovation, and inevitably must resort to theft.  Theft is not innovation.  By combatting theft, we protect innovation and freedom,\" said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California.', '\"Economic Espionage is a pervasive threat throughout the United States, particularly to the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley which is the center of innovation and technology,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett.  \"While this case exemplifies how easily a few motivated employees can conspire to misappropriate intellectual property for the benefit of the People\\'s Republic of China, Zhang\\'s conviction should serve as a warning to our adversaries that the FBI and our partners remain committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting these crimes.\"', \"According evidence presented during the bench trial, Zhang stole trade secrets relating the performance of wireless devices.  Specifically, Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters are used in wireless devices to eliminate interference and improve other aspects of device performance.  Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBAR) are one type of BAW filter.  The most common and most profitable application of FBAR technology is as a radio frequency (RF) filter for mobile phones and other wireless devices.  Technological advances in FBARs have played a substantial role in creating smaller, more efficient wireless devices for both consumer and military applications.  Avago, one of the victims of Zhang's theft, was the leading company in the United States manufacturing and selling FBARs.  Zhang's other victim, Skyworks, was developing its own BAW technology.\", \"Evidence at trial further showed that in October 2006, Zhang and his co-conspirators started a business in China to compete with Avago and Skyworks.  One of Zhang's co-conspirators, Wei Pang, started working at Avago at the same time.  Zhang and Pang illicitly shared trade secrets with each other and with co-conspirators in China while they worked for the U.S. companies.  Zhang and Pang then connected their venture to Tianjin University (TJU) in China, an instrumentality of the Chinese government.  By 2009, they left their work in the United States to relocate to China, following a plan laid out by TJU officials to form another company, Novana, in the Cayman Islands.  Along the way, Zhang obtained patents in his own name using trade secret information he knew was stolen from Avago.  Zhang also worked with stolen trade secrets in a lab he founded at TJU while developing his new FBAR business. The FBAR processes that Zhang and his co-conspirators stole took Avago over twenty years of research and development to build.  Additional evidence during the bench trial demonstrated that Zhang engaged in economic espionage to help TJU and Zhang's Chinese company unfairly compete in the multi-billion dollar global market for cell phone RF filters. \", 'Zhang was charged in a superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury on April 1, 2015.', 'Zhang is currently released on a $500,000 secured bond. ', \"Zhang's sentencing hearing is scheduled for Aug. 31, 2020, before Judge Davila in San San Jose.  The maximum statutory penalty for each count in violation of 18 U.S.C.

      "['Remarks as Prepared for Delivery', \"Good morning.  I am here to announce the indictment of Chinese military hackers - specifically, four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army - for breaking into the computer systems of the credit-reporting agency Equifax, and for stealing the sensitive personal information of nearly half of all American citizens, and also Equifax's hard-earned intellectual property.\", \"This was one of the largest data breaches in history.  It came to light in the summer of 2017, when Equifax announced the theft.  The scale of the theft was staggering.  As alleged in the indictment, the hackers obtained the names, birth dates, and social security numbers of nearly 150 million Americans, and the driver's license numbers of at least 10 million Americans.  This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax, but invaded the privacy of many millions of Americans, and imposed substantial costs and burdens on them as they have had to take measures to protect against identity theft.\", \"As described in the indictment, the hackers broke into Equifax's network through a vulnerability in the company's dispute resolution website.  Once in the network, the hackers spent weeks conducting reconnaissance, uploading malicious software, and stealing login credentials, all to set the stage to steal vast amounts of data from Equifax's systems.  While doing this, the hackers also stole Equifax's trade secrets, embodied by the compiled data and complex database designs used to store the personal information.  Those trade secrets were the product of decades of investment and hard work by the company.\", \"Today's announcement comes after two years of investigation.  According to the nine-count indictment handed down by a grand jury in Atlanta, four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, or PLA - Wang Qian, Wu Zhiyong, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei - are alleged to have conspired to hack Equifax's computer systems and commit economic espionage.  In doing so, they are alleged to have damaged Equifax's computer systems and to have committed wire fraud.\", \"This kind of attack on American industry is of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data.  For years, we have witnessed China's voracious appetite for the personal data of Americans, including the theft of personnel records from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the intrusion into Marriott hotels, and Anthem health insurance company, and now the wholesale theft of credit and other information from Equifax.  This data has economic value, and these thefts can feed China's development of artificial intelligence tools as well as the creation of intelligence targeting packages. \", 'In addition to thefts of sensitive personal data, our cases reveal a pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China targeting trade secrets and confidential business information: hacks by a group known as APT 10, which worked in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, or MSS, to target managed service providers and their clients worldwide across industries; hacks by MSS intelligence officers who sought to steal intellectual property related to turbofan engines by using both insiders and computer operations, and; hacks by PLA officers who targeted victims in the nuclear power, metals, and solar products industries for the economic benefit of Chinese companies.  Indeed, about 80 percent of our economic espionage prosecutions have implicated the Chinese government, and about 60 percent of all trade secret theft cases in recent years involved some connection to China.', \"We do not normally bring criminal charges against the members of another country's military or intelligence services outside the United States.  In general, traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law.  There are exceptions to this rule, of course.  For instance, we have brought charges against intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States.  And more recently, we have charged state-sponsored actors for computer intrusions into the United States for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of their private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections.  Like those cases, the deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians, as occurred here, cannot be countenanced.   \", 'The United States, like other nations, has gathered intelligence throughout its history to ensure that national security and foreign policy decisionmakers have access to timely, accurate, and insightful information.  But we collect information only for legitimate national security purposes; we do not indiscriminately violate the privacy of ordinary civilians. ', \" Today's indictment would not have been possible without the hard work of a dedicated team of FBI agents and federal prosecutors in Atlanta and here in Washington, D.C.  In addition, the Department's Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance in working with other nations to secure evidence located overseas.  Notably, Equifax cooperation throughout the investigation was critical to our development of the case.\", 'I would like to now invite U.S. Attorney BJay Pak to provide remarks.', '***', 'The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

They allegedly conspired with each other to hack into Equifax's computer networks, maintain unauthorized access to those computers, and steal sensitive, personally identifiable information of approximately 145 million American victims.\", '\"This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people,\" said Attorney General William P. Barr, who made the announcement. \"Today, we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the Internet\\'s cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us. Unfortunately, the Equifax hack fits a disturbing and unacceptable pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China and its citizens that have targeted personally identifiable information, trade secrets, and other confidential information.\"', \"According to the indictment, the defendants exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web Framework software used by Equifax's online dispute portal.  They used this access to conduct reconnaissance of Equifax's online dispute portal and to obtain login credentials that could be used to further navigate Equifax's network.  The defendants spent several weeks running queries to identify Equifax's database structure and searching for sensitive, personally identifiable information within Equifax's system.  Once they accessed files of interest, the conspirators then stored the stolen information in temporary output files, compressed and divided the files, and ultimately were able to download and exfiltrate the data from Equifax's network to computers outside the United States. In total, the attackers ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's system, obtaining names, birth dates and social security numbers for nearly half of all American citizens.\", 'The indictment also charges the defendants with stealing trade secret information, namely Equifax\\'s data compilations and database designs.  \"In short, this was an organized and remarkably brazen criminal heist of sensitive information of nearly half of all Americans, as well as the hard work and intellectual property of an American company, by a unit of the Chinese military,\" said Barr.', \"The defendants took steps to evade detection throughout the intrusion, as alleged in the indictment.  They routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, used encrypted communication channels within Equifax's network to blend in with normal network activity, and deleted compressed files and wiped log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their activity.\", '\"Today\\'s announcement of these indictments further highlights our commitment to imposing consequences on cybercriminals no matter who they are, where they are, or what country\\'s uniform they wear,\" said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.  \"The size and scope of this investigation -- affecting nearly half of the U.S. population, demonstrates the importance of the FBI\\'s mission and our enduring partnerships with the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office.  This is not the end of our investigation; to all who seek to disrupt the safety, security and confidence of the global citizenry in this digitally connected world, this is a day of reckoning.\"', 'The defendants are charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  The defendants are also charged with two counts of unauthorized access and intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of economic espionage, and three counts of wire fraud. ', \"The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Criminal and National Security Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the FBI's Atlanta Field Office.

      "['Remarks as Prepared for Delivery', 'Thank you, Jim Lewis, for that kind introduction, and thank you for hosting this event. ', 'My original career goal was to go into the CIA as a China expert, and so I focused on Chinese studies for my BA and MA at Columbia University.  I remember in one of my Government classes, we were having a debate as to which foreign adversary posed the greatest long-term threat - Russia or China.', 'I recall the observation of one of my classmates in arguing that it was China that posed the greatest threat. He said, \"Russia wants to conquer the world.  We can deal with that. China wants to own the world.  That is going to be more challenging to deal with.\"  There was a certain truth in that.', \"In 1972, our hope was that integrating China into the international economic system would encourage the People's Republic of China (PRC) to liberalize its economy, and that a free market and economic growth would gradually lead to greater political freedom for its citizens. \", 'Unfortunately, economic liberalization has only gone so far.  While individuals have been permitted some degree of economic freedom, the Communist Party remains in firm control of the economy.  It is an architecture of state power, whose principal features are central planning, state-owned enterprises, and government subsidies.', 'Politically, the PRC remains a dictatorship under which the Communist Party elite jealously guards its monopoly on power.  Marxism-Leninism and Maoism linger on as justification for Communist rule, which is authoritarian through and through.', 'The Communist party is willing to resort to harsh measures to repress any challenge to its one-party rule, whether it be suppressing religious organizations, rounding up and \"re-educating\" Uighurs, resisting efforts of self-determination in Hong Kong, or using the Great Firewall to limit access to ideas and penalize their expression.', \"For a brief time after the Cold War, we had indulged the illusion of democratic capitalism as triumphant, unchallenged by any competing ideology.  That was nice while it lasted.  But we are now in a new era of global tension and competition.  China has emerged as the United States' top geopolitical adversary, based on competing political and economic philosophies.\", 'Centuries before Communism, China regarded itself as the Central Kingdom -the center of the world.  Its ambition today is not to be a regional power, but a global one. ', 'For China, success is a zero-sum game.  In the words of then-General Secretary Xi, Communist Party members should \"concentrate [their] efforts on . . . building a socialism that is superior to capitalism.\"  Such efforts, Xi claimed, would require Party members to \"consecrate [their] entire spirit, [their] entire life,\" for socialist ideals.  The reward for this sacrifice, Xi promised, is \"the eventual demise of capitalism.\"', \"I mentioned my classmate's comment about China wanting to own the world because, today, I'd like to focus on the challenge of China's drive for economic and technological supremacy.  But I am not suggesting that China's ambitions are merely economic, or that our competition with China is, at bottom, merely an economic rivalry.\", 'The Chinese have long been a commercial people, but for China, purely economic success is not an end in itself.  It is a means to wider political and strategic objectives.  Throughout its long history, China has always used its economic strength as a tool to achieve its political and strategic objectives.', 'In 2015, the Chinese leadership launched its \"Made in China 2025\" plan --  a sustained, highly-coordinated campaign to replace the United States as the dominant technological superpower.  The dictatorship has mobilized all elements of Chinese society - all government, all corporations, all academia, and all of its industrious people - to execute seamlessly an ambitious plan to dominate the core technologies of the future.', 'This drive is backed by industrial policy involving huge investments in key technologies, massive financing, and subsidies in the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars.', \"Unfortunately, it also involves industrial espionage and theft of technology and intellectual property, as well as forced technology transfers, predatory pricing, leveraging China's foreign direct investment, and strong-arm sales tactics in target markets, including the use of corruption.  \", \"Make no mistake about it - China's current technological thrusts pose an unprecedented challenge to the United States.\", \"The stakes for the United States could not be higher.  Since the 19th century, the United States has been the world's leader in innovation and technology.  It has been America's technological prowess that has made us prosperous and secure.  Our standard of living, our expanding economic opportunities for our young people and coming generations, and our national security all depend on our continued technological leadership.  \", \"In the past, prior administrations and many in the private sector have too often been willing to countenance China's hardball tactics.  It has been this administration that has finally moved to confront and counteract China's playbook.\", \"Today, I want to focus on two aspects of the challenge we face.  The first is how China jumpstarts its technology initiatives by stealing our technology.  Second, I want to explain why China's current focus on dominating 5G technology is of central concern.\", 'The ability of totalitarian countries to engage in central economic planning can, at times, appear to be an advantage, especially when mobilizing the kind of technological blitzkrieg we see unfolding today. ', 'The downside is that central planning suppresses technological innovation.  Breakthrough ideas arise in free societies like ours, which have long led the way in cutting-edge technological development ', 'The Chinese are trying to have it both ways.  While orchestrating a centrally-planned campaign to dominate key technologies, they are attempting to capture the benefits of our free society by outright stealing our technology.  The stealing of technology is not a sideshow.  It undergirds and propels their efforts.', 'As John Demers, our Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division observed, \"China wants the fruits of America\\'s brainpower to harvest the seeds of its planned economic dominance.\"', \"In 2018, the Department of Justice launched its China Initiative to confront China's malign behaviors and protect U.S. technology.\", \"As the presentations earlier this morning demonstrated, investigations during the department's China Initiative have repeatedly shown how the PRC is using intelligence services and tradecraft to target valuable scientific and technical information held by the private sector and the academy.  These cover a wide range of technologies, from those applicable to commercial airplane engines to renewable energy to new materials to high-tech agriculture.  Since the announcement of the Made in China 2025 plan, for example, the department has brought trade-secret theft cases in eight of the 10 technology sectors China is aspiring to dominate.\", 'In targeting these sectors, the PRC employs a multipronged approach: engaging in cyber intrusions, co-opting private sector insiders through its intelligence services, and using non-traditional collectors, such as graduate students participating in university research projects. ', \"With respect to remote computer intrusions, for example, the department's indictment of APT 10 hackers in December 2018 outlined a global campaign, associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, targeting intellectual property and confidential business and technology information belonging to hundreds of clients of managed service providers worldwide. \", 'Chinese theft by hacking has continued, and you should expect more indictments and prosecutions in the future.', 'Outside cyberspace, defendants pose as U.S. customers to avoid export controls, and recruit U.S. employees or co-opt insiders to steal trade secrets.', 'At academic and other research institutions, China uses \"talent programs\" to encourage the theft of intellectual property.', 'Finally, China complements its plainly illicit activity with facially legal, but predatory behavior: the acquisitions of U.S. companies and other investments in the U.S.', 'The department confronts these threats through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and Team Telecom.  As one example, earlier this year, based on a recommendation from Justice and other agencies, the Federal Communications Commission denied a license to China Mobile on national security grounds.   ', \"The PRC's economic aggression and theft of intellectual property comes with immense costs.  It has been estimated that the annual cost to the U.S. economy could be as high as $600 billion.\", 'The department will continue to use our full suite of national security tools to combat the threat posed by theft directed and encouraged by the PRC. ', 'But, as the Director stressed, our ability to protect American technology will ultimately depend on a partnership with industry and the academy.  ', 'Now let me turn to a very concrete problem that confronts us today.  It is the pivotal nature of 5G technology and the threat arising from the Chinese drive to dominate this field.', '5G technology lies at the center of the technological and industrial world that is taking shape.  In essence, communications networks are not just for communications anymore. They are evolving into the central nervous system of the next generation of internet, called the \"Industrial Internet,\" and the next generation of industrial systems that will depend on that infrastructure.  China has built up a lead in 5G, capturing 40 percent of the global 5G infrastructure market.  For the first time in history, the United States is not leading the next technology era.', \"Much of the discussion on the dangers of allowing China to establish dominance in 5G has been focused on the immediate security concern of using communications networks that China can monitor and surveil.  That is, in fact, a monumental danger.  For that reason alone, we should mobilize to surmount China's drive to dominate 5G. But the stakes are far higher than this. \", 'It has been estimated that the Industrial Internet powered by 5G could generate new economic opportunities of $23 trillion by 2025.  If China establishes sole dominance over 5G, it will be able to dominate the opportunities arising from a stunning range of emerging technologies that will be dependent on, and interwoven with the 5G platform.', 'From a national security standpoint, if the Industrial Internet becomes dependent on Chinese technology, China would have the ability to shut countries off from technology and equipment upon which their consumers and industry depend.  The power the United States has today to use economic sanctions would pale by comparison to the unprecedented economic leverage we would be surrendering into the hands of China.', 'It is important to understand how 5G will enable a revolution in industrial processes.  Some Americans think that all we are talking about here is analogous to the shift from 3G to 4G in our wireless networks.  But we are talking about a change that is far more fundamental than merely increasing download speeds for movies and websites.  ', 'The move from 3G to 4G meant moving from download speeds of about one Mbps up to speeds of about 20 Mbps.  This increase made it possible to move the storage of data and some modest processing power off of devices and into \"the cloud.\"  Even this modest evolution of the wireless business spawned wide new fields of innovation, applications, and businesses.  Because the United States was the country that developed 4G, we were the country that captured most of the economic opportunity that flowed from that technology.', 'The jump to 5G is a quantum leap beyond this.  We are now talking about multi-Gigabits per second peak rates for both download and upload.  These fiber-like speeds, coupled with placing \"Edge Computing\" facilities closer to the users, means 5G is capable of extremely low latency - under 10 milliseconds.  With this capacity, the tiniest devices can have virtually instantaneous interconnectivity, and access infinite computing power.  With these characteristics, 5G becomes a real time, precise command and control system.', 'Devices of all kinds - some \"smart,\" some sensors collecting and transmitting data, and some actuators carrying out remote commands - can be dispersed and embedded in business and industrial equipment across a wide array of businesses, such as transportation, energy, finance, healthcare, agriculture, heavy construction, and so forth.  5G provides the command-and-control function for managing industrial processes. ', 'As the world of 5G unfolds, we will be seeing not just smart homes, but smart farms, smart factories, smart heavy construction, smart transportation systems, and so forth.  And a host of new emerging technologies, in addition to AI, will become interwoven with and dependent upon 5G and the Industrial Internet, including for example: robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.', 'China has stolen a march and is now leading in 5G.  5G is an infrastructure business.  It relies on a Radio Access Network (RAN).  China has two of the leading RAN infrastructure suppliers: Hwawei and ZTE.  Together, they have already captured 40 percent of the market, and are aggressively pursuing the balance.', \"Huawei is now the leading supplier on every continent, except North America.  The United States does not have an equipment supplier.  China's principal competitors are the Finish firm, Nokia (with a 17 percent share) and the Swedish firm Ericsson (with a 14 percent share).\", \"The Chinese are using every lever of power to expand their 5G market share around the globe.  It is estimated that the total market for 5G infrastructure is $76 billion.  China is offering over $100 billion in incentives to finance customers' purchases of its equipment.  This means that the Chinese can offer customers to build their 5G networks for no money down.\", \"In an infrastructure business like 5G, scale is critical.  The business requires huge investments in R & D, as well as very high capital costs.  The larger a company's market share, the better it can afford these costs.  Competitors facing a shrinking addressable market find it harder to sustain the levels of investment required to stay competitive.\", 'Chinese companies start with the advantage of the largest domestic market, giving them instant scale, and as they add to this around the world, they will be able to invest more in their technology.', 'The more China gains ground as a supplier of 5G infrastructure, the more it will gain ground in all the constituent technologies that undergird 5G infrastructure. ', '5G rests on a stack of technologies, including semiconductors, fiber optics, and rare earth and materials.  China has moved to domesticate all these elements so it will not be dependent on foreign suppliers. ', \"Semiconductors provide a good example of the ripple effect of Chinese leadership in 5G.  China now consumes over half of the world's semiconductors.  China has now started to replace U.S. semiconductors with its own.  Its scale in this field will permit it to make the investments needed close the current quality gap.  As China builds its scale in the semiconductor industry, it will place substantial pressure on alternative suppliers.  And, of course, semiconductors are indispensable to a wide range of technology and industries apart from 5G.\", \"China's success in 5G infrastructure is also translating into advantages in a range of new technologies associated with 5G.  AI is a good example.  As China captures more and more of the data generated by 5G, its AI products become better. \", 'Within the next five years, 5G global territory and application dominance will be determined. ', 'The question is whether, within this window, the United States and our allies can mount sufficient competition to Huawei to retain and capture enough market share to sustain the kind of long-term and robust competitive position necessary to avoid surrendering dominance to the Chinese.', 'The time is very short.  We and our allies have to act quickly.  While much has to be done, it is imperative to make two decisions right away.', 'First, we have to deploy the spectrum necessary for a robust 5G system in the U.S.  This is the mid-band spectrum called the \"C-band.\" ', 'The FCC has been working hard to get the C-band spectrum out into the market through an auction.  It is critical to get this done within the next few months.  Even then, the U.S. will need 400,000 base stations to cover the nation.  This could take a decade or more to build out.', 'Recently, there have been interesting proposals to jump-start U.S.  5G by also making available L-band spectrum for use in tandem with the C-band.  By using the L-band for uplink, we could dramatically reduce the number of base stations required to complete national coverage.  It has been suggested that this could cut the time for U.S. 5G deployment from a decade to 18 months, and save approximately $80 million.  While some technical issues about using the L-band are being debated, it is imperative that the FCC resolves this question.', 'The bottom line is that we have to move decisively to auction the C-band spectrum, and bring to resolution the issues over L-band.  Our economic future is at stake.  We have to bear in mind that, given the narrow window we face, the risk of losing the 5G struggle with China should vastly outweigh all other considerations.', 'Second, we have to make a decision on the \"horse\" we are going to ride in this race.  Who is the 5G equipment supplier, or suppliers, that we will rely on to compete against Huawei around the globe, win contracts from operators, and blunt Huawei\\'s drive to domination?', \"It's all very well to tell our friends and allies that they shouldn't install Huawei, but whose infrastructure are they going to install? \", \"If we and our allies - and other countries that do not want to put their economic fate in China's hands - are not going to install Huawei's infrastructure, we have to have a market-ready alternative today.\", \"What is the customer looking for after all?  What is the operator looking for in moving from 4G to 5G?  It is a one-time decision.  It is a big decision.  You cannot afford to make a mistake, you need to know you are buying a reliable system that will perform, because you don't have the luxury of tearing it out down the road.  And, you need a system that will allow you to seamlessly migrate your installed 4G base to 5G.  You need to know that your supplier has staying power - they are not here today and gone tomorrow.  They will be there for the long-haul.  Those are the products that are necessary to win contracts today. \", \"There are only two companies that can compete with Huawei right now as 5G infrastructure suppliers: Nokia and Ericsson.  They have quality, reliable products that can guarantee performance.  They have proven successful in managing customers' migration from 4G to 5G.  The main concern about these suppliers is that they have neither Huawei's scale nor the backing of a powerful country with a large market, like China. \", 'Some propose that these concerns could be met by the United States aligning itself with Nokia and/or Ericsson through American ownership of a controlling stake, either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies.  Putting our large market and financial muscle behind one or both of these firms would make it a more formidable competitor and eliminate concerns over its staying power.  We and our closest allies certainly need to be actively considering this approach.', 'Recently, there has been some talk about trying to develop an Open RAN approach, which aims to force open the RAN into its components and have those components to be developed by U.S. and western innovators.  The problem is that this is just pie in the sky.  This approach is completely untested, and would take many years to get off the ground, and would not be ready for prime time for a decade, if ever.', \"What we need today is a product that can win contracts right now - a proven infrastructure that network operators will make a long-term commitment to today.  In other words, we need a product that can blunt and turnaround Huawei's momentum currently.\", 'As a dictatorship, China can marshal an all-of-nation approach - the government, private companies, and academia acting together as one.', \"We are not able to compel that.  When we have faced similar challenges in the past - such as  World War II, and Russia's Cold War technological challenge - as a free people we rallied together.  We were able to form a close partnership among government, the private sector, and academia.  And through that cooperation, we prevailed.\", 'Unfortunately, the cooperative bonds and sense of purpose we were able to muster in the past are harder to call on today.', \"And, in the 1950's, we had the Sputnik moment that helped galvanize the nation and bring unity to our response.  We have not seen a similar catalyst today.\", 'If we are going to maintain our technological leadership, our economic strength, and ultimately our national security, we need the public and private sectors to work together and come shoulder to shoulder.', \"To our private sector friends, I would say that appeasing the PRC may come with short-term benefits, but I urge you to question the longstanding assumption that promises of market access are worth the steep costs.  The PRC's ultimate goal is to replace you with a Chinese company.\", 'University and think-tank colleagues, do not allow the theft of technology under the guise of academic freedom.  Do not allow the PRC to dictate your research or pressure you into ignoring diverse voices on controversial topics.  Consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the tradeoff.', \"To our allies, we applaud your efforts to stand up to China's economic power.  But we must do more, and act collectively.  Let us not forget our collective economic influence and power.\", 'Throughout history, free societies have faced regimented adversaries.  At critical junctures, they have achieved the unity and purpose necessary to prevail, not because they have been compelled to do so, but because they freely chose to do so.  We must make that choice today.', '***', 'The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

It's an event that benefits all of us.\", 'Since this conference first began more than a decade ago, we have seen dramatic changes in IP crime:', 'So what is the Department doing to keep up in this ever-changing landscape?', 'First and foremost, we employ the expertise of attorneys across the Department and our federal prosecutors across the country to bring high-impact cases to deter IP crime.', 'I wanted to highlight some examples of recent prosecutions that show the diligence and creativity of our investigators and prosecutors in bringing these cases.', 'Online Copyright Infringement - Jetflicks', 'In August, we announced charges in the Eastern District of Virginia against eight Las Vegas residents for running two of the largest unauthorized streaming services in the country. ', 'One of the services - known as Jetflicks - allegedly obtained infringing television programs by using sophisticated computer scripts to scour pirate websites around the world and collect the television shows. ', 'It then made the programming available for paying Jetflicks subscribers to stream and download, often just one day after the original episodes aired.', 'The scheme, as charged, resulted in the loss of millions of dollars by television program and motion picture copyright owners. ', 'This case demonstrates how IP criminals are leveraging technology to operate at unprecedented scale and speed.

', \"CCIPS Senior Counsel Matt Lamberti, who is working with the Eastern District of Virginia U.S. Attorney's Office on the Jetflicks prosecution, is here with us today.\", 'In addition to unlimited free content, these services will often install malicious software that can compromise the computer security of unwitting consumers, sending passwords, financial information and other personal information to be distributed for profit on the internet. ', 'Trafficking In Counterfeit Goods - Container Shipping', 'The Department of Justice also has obtained a slew of guilty pleas in a massive 22-defendant counterfeit importation conspiracy charged in the Eastern District of New York, resulting in the dismantling of one of the largest counterfeit goods trafficking rings ever uncovered in the United States.', 'These conspirators trafficked not drugs nor electronics, but counterfeit luxury goods that were made in China: fake Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Michael Kors handbags, wallets, belts, perfume, and other merchandise. ', 'This operation is significant in both its scope and scale--had the items been legitimate, it is estimated that the value would be over $1 billion in total, making it one of the largest counterfeit luxury goods cases in U.S. history.', 'Members of the conspiracy engaged in multiple schemes to avoid detection, pretending to be representatives of legitimate importation companies, submitting false paperwork to customs authorities, and lying about the nature of the goods in customs declarations.', 'Once the goods were in the U.S., conspirators sold those counterfeit items in multiple jurisdictions across the country, and laundered millions of dollars of proceeds.', 'To date, 20 defendants have pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of New York and New York state court in this investigation and related cases.  CCIPS Senior Counsel James Yoon, one of the prosecutors working on Operation TMG, is in the audience today.', 'Trade Secret Theft - Syntactic Foam', 'This past summer, following a nine-day jury trial, an engineer and former employee of a Houston company was convicted of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets in federal court in the District of Columbia.

Shih and Mai concealed Shih's true intent to transfer the U.S. company's products to the People's Republic of China.  The MMICs that Shih sent to China required a license from the Commerce Department before being exported to China, and a license was never sought or obtained for this export.\", \"The victim company's semiconductor chips have a number of commercial and military applications, and its customers include the Air Force, Navy and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  MMICs are used in missiles, missile guidance systems, fighter jets, electronic warfare, electronic warfare countermeasures and radar applications.\", 'The semiconductor chips at the heart of this case were shipped to Chengdu GaStone Technology Company (CGTC), a Chinese company that was building a MMIC manufacturing facility in Chengdu.  Shih was the president of CGTC, which in 2014 was placed on the Commerce Department\\'s Entity List, according to court documents, \"due to its involvement in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interest of the United States - specifically, that it had been involved in the illicit procurement of commodities and items for unauthorized military end use in China.\"', 'Shih used a Hollywood Hills-based company he controlled - Pullman Lane Productions LLC - to funnel funds provided by Chinese entities to finance the manufacturing of MMICs by the victim company.  Pullman Lane received financing from a Beijing-based company that was placed on the Entity List the same day as CGTC \"on the basis of its involvement in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,\" according to court documents.', 'Shih and Mai were indicted in this case in January 2018.  Mai pleaded guilty in December 2018 to one felony count of smuggling and is scheduled to be sentenced on September 19, at which time he will face a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison.', 'This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement; and IRS Criminal Investigation, with assistance from the Royal  Canadian Mounted Police.', \"The matter is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Judith A. Heinz, Melanie Sartoris, Khaldoun Shobaki and William Rollins of the National Security Division, Assistant United States Attorney James C.

      "['Remarks as Prepared for Delivery', 'Good Morning, and thank you.', \"I want to thank Rob Hur and Zach Terwilliger, for bringing this Conference together. Thank you also to Jessie Liu, John Huber, and Jim Crowell for their leadership of the Attorney General's Advisory Council (AGAC) and the Executive Office of U.S. Attorney's (EOUSA). And of course, to Tim Garrison for a wonderful rendition of our National Anthem.\", 'I also want to thank all of you, our United States Attorneys. As I told you when I came on board, I firmly believe that no finer complement of U.S. Attorneys has ever been assembled. The intervening months have only strengthened that conviction. I have met most of you individually and have seen the great results of all of your work up close, in specific cases and in the aggregate. It is a privilege to serve with you, and I look forward to working with all of you in the months ahead.', \"Much has changed here at Main Justice since last year's U.S. Attorney's Conference. You have this old Attorney General as your new Attorney General. The Department has also welcomed a new Deputy Attorney General, Jeff Rosen. Those of you have met and worked with Jeff will already know that he is a superlative lawyer with broad experience at senior government levels, as well as the private sector. He will make great contributions to the Department. We also have new leadership in the Associate's Office, where Claire Murray now serves as Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General.\", 'But while much has changed at the Department over the past year, much has also stayed the same. As I told you months ago, I support the prosecutorial priorities that Attorney General Sessions put in place. We remain focused on violent crime, drugs, immigration, and national security. There are also a number of specific initiatives AG Sessions established which I hope to continue and bolster. As I said on my first day back, it is \"full speed ahead.\"', \"Over the last several months, I have been struck by a contradiction that you no doubt experience every day. On the one hand, the Department's law-enforcement efforts are at their all-time best. We have dedicated agents and Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) working tirelessly to enforce federal law. You and your teams are exhausting all available resources to maximize our impact in individual communities and across the Nation. On the other hand, the threats we face are greater and more complex than ever. We still see persistent violent crime; growing national-security threats; record threats from illegal drug distribution; the increasing reach of transnational criminal organizations; and a crisis at our Southern Border -- all despite the Department's record-breaking efforts.\", 'Much of what we are doing today is trying to make up ground that was lost as the result of inattention in the past. I assure you that with sustained efforts and firm resolve we will make up this ground and surmount these challenges. I want you to know that I support you and your teams and will do all I can to step up the fight.', \"One of these priorities has been fresh on my mind of late, and that is violent crime. We were all alarmed by the events last week in Dallas, Texas, where a disturbed veteran opened fire at the federal courthouse, including on three AUSAs and one of their children. We are fortunate that the would-be shooter was the only casualty. And I am proud of the response from the courthouse security, from the FBI, and from our U.S. Attorney's Office under the leadership of Erin Nealy Cox.\", 'The personal safety of our AUSAs is of the utmost concern to me, as it is to you. I have been closely focused on proposals by the AGAC to ensure the safety of our prosecutors. I assure you our AUSAs will have the authority and the tools they need to do their jobs effectively and to keep themselves and their families safe.', 'Today we are the lucky ones. Far too often I find myself sending condolence letters to the families of fallen law enforcement officers. Just in the past week or so, we have seen five officers killed in the line of duty, four of them shot by armed criminals. Police officers selflessly put their lives on the line to keep us safe. Attacks on them are attacks on all of us. These and other incidents are connected to an emerging willingness in some quarters of our society to countenance resistance to, and violence against, police officers. This Department will not tolerate violence against police, and we will do all we can to protect the safety of law enforcement officers.', \"We can all be rightly proud of this Administration's record on violent crime. We have made impressive progress. But we must keep up a full court press. There are still areas of the country where we have not made sufficient headway. For many communities in America, armed criminals and violent crime are still the norm. We cannot accept this status quo.\", 'That is why the Department remains committed to driving down violent crime, including through the vigorous prosecution of firearms offenses. I have been glad to see that prosecutions under SS 922(g) are at an all-time high. We need to maintain our focus on getting illegal guns off the streets and out of the hands of violent criminals. I want all of our offices to work with their state and local partners on \"Triggerlock\" cases that take advantage of stiff federal penalties to punish and deter violent felons. I also want to see vigorous enforcement of the background-check process, both against prohibited persons who \"lie and try\" and against firearm dealers who skirt the process. We need to provide real deterrence. I look forward to working with all of you to step up our drive against gun crime.', 'As you all know, we also cannot reduce violent crime without confronting the role of gangs and other criminal organizations. Working with our state and local partners, we must keep sustained pressure on these groups, which are primary drivers of violent crime. Many of these criminal organization have national or transnational profiles, and thus require a coordinated federal strategy. We are already working with the AGAC and our national task force leaders on strategies for the top transnational threats. But whatever the scale, the Department needs to use all available tools to dismantle these groups and to disrupt their efforts. RICO is one powerful tool to neutralize violent criminal organizations, and I know some of you are using it very effectively. We should strive to duplicate those efforts across the country.', 'While I am talking about violent crime, I want to make clear that, while our focus is often on predatory violence, I am also deeply concerned about the rise in hate crimes that we have seen over the past decade. We must have zero tolerance for violence that is motivated by hatred for our fellow citizens -- whether on the basis of their racial, religious, or sexual characteristics. We also need to take a strong stand against those who would use violence to intimidate people from exercising their rights to free speech and to participate in the democratic process.', 'In addition to guns and gangs, the other significant driver of violent crime is drug crime, which represents another priority for the Department. When I returned to the Department as Attorney General, it was disheartening to learn about the state of the drug problem across the country. In most respects, the problem is much worse than when I left the Department in 1993. I believe that the last Administration was not aggressive enough in fighting the drug threat; a lot of ground was lost; and a tsunami was allowed to build up that has been hitting the country.', 'We cannot be discouraged. When I look at the overdose deaths, the blighted lives, and the families and communities broken by drug addiction, it reminds me why we cannot surrender. We must work harder than ever.', 'I am proud that this Administration has shone a much-needed light on the opioid epidemic and that the Department has taken a number of dramatic steps to tackle this national crisis head on. And while there are encouraging signs of progress, our work is far from over. On the streets, the rise of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has been followed by 100-times stronger car-fentanyl and by mixtures of fentanyl with cocaine and other drugs. We must also continue our efforts to prevent and punish diversion of licit drugs, another area where the Department has done great work. And, as you know, while opioids are the most acute problem in many areas of the country, in other areas Mexican methamphetamine is surging. We must keep fighting and keep innovating to match the ever-evolving threat.', 'We all know we face an unprecedented immigration crisis on our Southern Border. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is in the lead on tackling this problem. A lasting solution will require changing our laws, but in the meanwhile we must do all we can to support DHS. We have to continue our work prosecuting the illegal reentry cases that DHS refers. But even if we devoted every AUSA in the country to those cases, we would not resolve the crisis at our Southern border through prosecutions alone. That is why I am also working to address the problem through a surge of immigration judges, new Attorney General rulings, revised regulations in coordination with DHS, and a host of other measures. Most dramatically, the President has achieved a real breakthrough in our relations with Mexico, whereby the Mexican government is taking a series of critical measures to control the flow of illegal migration. Just the initial steps are starting to bite. There is a real prospect that these actions, along with efforts in Central America, will help us turn the corner.', 'National security must always be a top priority. The Department is fully committed to combatting terrorism, foreign intelligence threats, the theft of intellectual property by foreign adversaries, and cyber attacks. These efforts lie at the core of our sworn oath to defend the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.', \"First, over the last decade, we have achieved extraordinary successes in combatting terrorist threats at home and abroad, but we can never let down our guard. We must use all available lawful means to neutralize terrorists in the United States or elsewhere we find them within our reach. The United States relies on many tools to combat international terrorism and the work of the U.S. Attorneys' Offices has been a critical part of that effort. In appropriate cases, we will continue to prosecute terrorists as one important means to protect our citizens, by removing these deadly threats from the face of the map. \", 'Second, among the greatest threats to our national security are those posed by rival foreign powers. Foremost among these is China, which we know to have both a robust intelligence operation and an economic strategy that includes exploiting the intellectual property of our companies and citizens. We need to continue to pursue, and indeed step up, our China initiative. The threat of attack on our economic infrastructure, trade secrets and intellectual property is ever growing and we should be prepared to address it wherever we find it.', 'Finally, and relatedly, we remained focused on the growing and evolving cyber threat. In the twenty-first century, an increasing proportion of crime is cyber crime, as the dark web has become a black market of contraband that fuels criminal endeavors of all kinds. As organized crime becomes increasingly transnational, we see more and more crime move online. We have resources to address the cyber threats we face, but we must ensure that we use these resources efficiently to operate in an environment that grows increasingly vast and challenging.', 'As I alluded to earlier, there are also a number of other focused initiatives that I hope to see continue and strengthen during my tenure. For me, the elder-fraud initiative provides a great example for how the Department can use its resources with a high return. Not only is the elderly population among our most vulnerable citizens, but we are learning more and more about the role of foreign and transnational criminal organizations in perpetrating these schemes. Another area I want see us redouble our efforts is in prosecuting human trafficking violations, especially those involving children. We are working with the AGAC and several components on initiatives to step up the fight in this area.', 'That should give you a sense of my views on the priorities of the Department. But my charge today is not for you go out into the field and to maximize prosecutions in each of these categories. You will always need to strike a balance. And as you do, here are a few things to keep in mind:', 'First, in a Department like ours, the notion of priorities should not be confused. We have an obligation to enforce federal law, and that means covering all of the bases as best we can. If we say that the Department will prioritize violent crime prosecutions, we know that this cannot mean we ignore civil-rights violations or environmental crimes. We must try our best to enforce federal law across the board with the limited resources we have.', \"A necessary corollary is that federal prosecutors must exercise sound discretion to strike a balance. This balance requires that each of you adapt the Department's general priorities to the specific circumstances of your districts. Thus, while opioids represent the greatest drug threat in many districts, others face greater problems with methamphetamines or cocaine. And while transnational criminal organizations may be the primary driver of violent crime in one city, another may struggle with more localized, home-grown groups. Our Department priorities are never intended to take your eyes off the leading problems in your district, including the great work of your civil divisions, which protect government resources by defending the United States and rooting out fraud against the government. Each of you is responsible for determining where we can have the biggest impact in advancing the safety and well-being of your communities.\", 'Once we have decided where to dedicate our resources, we must do so efficiently. Tenacity is often a great attribute, but you must also be prepared to redirect efforts when prudence so dictates. We must remain thoughtful and objective in our analysis of the merits of an investigation, and to be nimble enough to reassess as circumstances change. Knowing when to drive on and when to redirect your limited resources is a critical part of leadership.', 'Third, we must take ownership and accept accountability for our decisions. Every indictment that comes out of your office bears your name and, as you know well, is your responsibility. It also ultimately reflects on the people who stand beside you in the U.S. Attorney community and all of us who work in the Department of Justice. That is a grave responsibility, but an essential one, because the legitimacy of our work depends on accountability, all the way up the chain from the line AUSA to me as Attorney General.', 'There is an inscription in my office, which I pass several times each day: \"The United States wins its point whenever justice is done its citizens in the courts.\" A prosecutor wields extraordinary power over his fellow citizens even when no criminal case is brought. Almost 80 years ago, Robert Jackson gave his well-known address \"The Federal Prosecutor\" to the U.S. Attorney\\'s Conference. If you have not read it in a while, you should before you head back home. Therein, Jackson describes the awesome power of the federal prosecutor and calls for a commitment to fairness and decency. We must always play fair in our efforts to bring criminal prosecutions or litigate on behalf of the United States.', 'Fairness must inform all that we do. After all, the whole concept of our American constitution was to establish a Government that could serve the common good while checking government power to protect individual liberty. And that is the Constitution we are sworn to support and defend. As you carry out your mission, I rely on you to lead wisely, hold those who injure the public accountable, and zealously represent the United States in court, while at the same time maintaining unshakable confidence in the rule of law and justice for all. That is your charge, and I know that you embrace it willingly, and well.', 'Thank you.']\n",

      "['\"The Rule of Law in the Age of Great Power Competition in Cyberspace\"', 'Remarks as prepared for delivery', \"It is a privilege to be here today to speak at the ABA Rule of Law Initiative's annual issues conference.  And I am honored to follow to the podium three prominent defenders of the rule of law, both at home and abroad.  Thank you, Judge McKeown, Mr. Mora, and Dr. Yang for dedicating your lives to upholding and promoting this noble ideal.\", 'Our theme today is the rule of law in cyberspace.  No topic could be more timely.  And no domain poses a greater threat to America\\'s public safety and national security.  As the Director of National Intelligence observed earlier this year, \"Our adversaries and strategic competitors will increasingly use cyber capabilities--including cyber espionage, attack, and influence--to seek political, economic, and military advantage over the United States and its allies and partners.\"[1]', 'The threat isn\\'t limited to state actors.  FBI Director Chris Wray informed Congress last fall that we also face sophisticated cyber threats from \"hackers for hire, organized crime syndicates, and terrorists.\"[2]  Not only do \"[t]hese threat actors constantly seek to access and steal our nation\\'s classified information, trade secrets, technology, and ideas--all of which are of great importance to U.S. national and economic security[--][t]hey   [also] seek to strike our critical infrastructure and to harm our economy.\"[3]', \"Reading quotes like this, you might think cyberspace is the 21st century equivalent of the 19th century Wild West.  It's true that actors in ungoverned physical spaces aim to spread instability around the globe, including through cyber means.  But much of the world's cyber instability today is caused by actors who live in very tightly governed spaces:  authoritarian nations like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.  These nations actively work to destabilize the U.S.-led international order, thereby promoting and advancing their own geopolitical interests.\", \"I'd like to use my time with you this morning to discuss three interrelated ideas.  The first is that we have moved into a new era of great power competition.  In its early years, the internet's openness seemed to represent an unvarnished good that would promote free thinking and human rights around the world; defeat authoritarianism; and drive the growth of new markets.  Today, that vision has darkened.  Our adversaries have used the internet to exercise control over their own populations.  And they have leveraged cyberspace's open and unregulated character to threaten our economic and national security; narrow our nation's strategic advantage; and attempt to undermine our values. \", 'The second idea relates to the importance of law in the new age of great power competition.  International law--that is, the law governing the relationships between sovereign states--applies in cyberspace, and could serve as a stabilizing force in this new era.  But international law in this context is still in its infancy, and many of the details remain to be worked out.  The reality is that states tend to follow their own rules, especially in the \"gray zone\" between peace and war where so much of today\\'s great power competition is taking place.  For that reason, I will emphasize U.S. domestic law, and the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice, in particular, plays in defending the rule of law in cyberspace, and in promoting global cyber norms.', \"Finally, I will briefly address a characteristic aspect of the new era in great power competition: foreign adversaries' weaponization of information in their attempts to sow discord in our society, undermine our democratic values, and disrupt the rule of law within our own borders.  I will explain how our domestic legal traditions empower us in this brave new era.  And I'll leave you with this thought:  Under the Constitution, we are not powerless to confront and to counter other nations' covert, deceptive misuse of cyberspace in their efforts to turn our free speech ideals against us.\", 'I.', 'Cyberspace was once seen as a medium for accelerating the spread of liberal values.  As Ira Magaziner, President Clinton\\'s \"internet czar,\" observed in 1999, \"The Internet is . . . a force for the promotion of democracy, because dictatorship depends upon the control of the flow of information.  The Internet makes this control much more difficult in the short run,\" he wrote, \"and impossible in the long run.\"[4]  \"In addition,\" Magaziner stated, \"the Internet will promote better understanding among nations,\"[5] and \"will be a tremendous force for improving education.\"[6]', \"Many thoughtful people shared those views, which in one form or another animated the internet governance policies of the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations.[7]  To be sure, technology firms experienced tremendous growth in those years, and the networked, interconnected world did draw closer together, creating obvious benefits.  But since then, we have learned that many of the policy choices made in the internet's infancy sowed the seeds of that early vision's destruction.\", \"To understand why, it's useful to consider the internet's structure.  The way our defense strategists sometimes conceive of it, cyberspace is composed of three interdependent layers: physical, logical, and persona.[8]  Hardware and tangible infrastructure comprise the physical layer; the human beings who develop a digital representation of themselves (such as an email address or a social media profile) to participate in internet-connected activity, comprise the persona layer.\", 'In the middle is the logical layer, in essence, the internet\\'s nervous system.  Colloquially, we think of this layer as \"code.\"  This is where data exists; it is also what links network nodes together, as packets of information move around the globe.  To promote rapid growth and universal connectivity, those who shaped the internet prioritized the logical layer\\'s openness, speed, and mutability.  They did not prioritize its security.  Many internet protocols simply assumed that every other computer on the network could be trusted.  Thus, for all its benefits, this open structure also came with a cost.  It wasn\\'t long before our adversaries began using this aspect of the internet\\'s openness against us.', 'At the same time, the internet has never been truly \"borderless\" in the sense of being completely undifferentiated.  As Jack Goldsmith observes, \"the very notion of an \\'Inter-net\\' implies fragmentation.\"[9]  As data packets move from one connected network to another, they can be filtered and routed based on various attributes, including the source of the data, and the intended destination.', 'Authoritarian nations have used filtering to control the content of the data that enters and exits their borders, and to monitor and censor what moves around within them.  China\\'s great firewall is probably the most notorious example; Russia\\'s reported plans to \"unplug\" from the global internet fall into the same category, as do that nation\\'s repeated calls in international fora for greater \"information security.\"  Thus, the growth of the internet actually fortified illiberal regimes\\' hold over their citizens, and empowered those governments in new and alarming ways.', 'Taken together, these trends have fundamentally reoriented international relations.  Over the past few years, our competitors have used cyberspace to consolidate authority at home, while accessing our information and intruding into our affairs in ways they could never do in a purely physical world.  All the while, they have carefully sought to operate below the threshold of the use of force, so as not to trigger an armed U.S. response.', 'Nevertheless, their tactics have become increasingly assertive.', 'As General Paul Nakasone, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, observes, \"Ten years ago, [cyber] threats were primarily [about] other nations\" engaging in espionage by \"coming into our networks and stealing information.\"[10]  That activity was serious enough.  The situation turned for the worse starting in 2013, when our adversaries \"began disrupting a series of networks within the United States,\"[11] often targeting and victimizing private parties.  From the denial of service attacks that Iran launched against our financial sector to the destructive attack it launched against an American casino; from North Korea\\'s targeted attack on Sony Pictures to its reckless propagation worldwide of the WannaCry ransomware; from Russia\\'s spread of the destructive NotPetya malware to the information operations it has launched against its adversaries around the world; from China\\'s mass theft of U.S. government personnel data to that nation\\'s sustained campaign of intellectual property theft--our adversaries, in General Nakasone\\'s words, have \"mount[ed] continuous, nonviolent [cyber] operations that produce cumulative, strategic impacts by eroding U.S. military, economic, and political power without reaching a threshold that triggers an armed response.\"[12] ', 'This, in a nutshell, is what we mean when we say that great power competition has revived--and that its \"locus . . . has shifted to cyberspace.\"[13]', 'II.', 'Both the latest National Security Strategy and the National Cyber Strategy identify a number of priority actions to ensure that America remains safe in this new era.  Law enforcement plays an important role in our shared, all-of-government effort.', 'At the U.S. Department of Justice, our primary missions include enforcing federal criminal law and protecting national security.  Combating cybercrime and cyber-enabled threats to our nation rate among our highest priorities.  For many years, we have targeted and successfully disrupted transnational criminal syndicates engaged in cybercrime, as well as the digital infrastructure those actors employ.  More recently, we began publicly charging foreign state actors whose malicious cyber activity broke U.S. law.  It is fair to ask why we devote significant resources to prosecuting state actors whom we may never bring to the United States to face justice.  And it is fair to ask why we shifted from an approach that relied mainly on intelligence collection and diplomacy to one that includes a law enforcement response.  As I will explain, prosecutions of state-sponsored malicious cyber activity serve an important purpose, even if we cannot guarantee that we will be able to produce in court every individual involved.', 'Since the indictment of Chinese PLA officers in 2014, the Department of Justice has remained focused on state-sponsored criminal activity that targets U.S. companies.  We are also now focused on activity that targets the U.S. political process.  In the past two years, the Department brought more national security cyber cases against criminals acting on behalf of our major adversaries than in the previous five years.', \"There are several reasons for the increasing prosecutions.  The main one is that we are following the threat, just as we did in responding to the threat of terrorism.  As I've explained, nation states are engaged in activity that victimizes individuals and companies in the United States, violates U.S. law, and departs from international norms of responsible state behavior--norms that benefit all nations.  Our criminal cases reflect our adversaries' efforts to harm our companies and our nation.\", \"Second, the increasing number of national security cyber cases reinforces the lesson that our adversaries' conduct lies outside the norms of responsible behavior.  The actions we highlight in indictments are not legitimate state-craft.  They are crimes without justification in international relations.  I will say more about that in a moment.\", 'Third, our cases reflect our increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute this criminal conduct to the individuals and states involved.  This ability is closely related to my second point, because it shows the commitment of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to work closely together, while protecting intelligence sources and methods.  These partnerships, which were forged in the counterterrorism context, serve to solidify the consensus that a law enforcement response to malign nation-state cyber activity makes sense.', 'In bringing these cases, we are guided by six basic principles.', \"First, the Department has a duty to enforce our laws and protect our people.  We cannot refuse to act when foreign state actors violate our criminal laws, transgress established norms, and victimize our citizens.  That is especially true when such crimes often represent severe violations of the victim's privacy rights, and can have lasting, damaging impact.  The Department has an obligation to work toward a future where our citizens can live and conduct their business with confidence in the integrity of their information and institutions.\", 'Second, attribution is the key to deterrence.  \"Without attribution, there will be no consequences . . . and thus, no deterrence.\"[14]  Attribution through the criminal justice system escalates the stakes for state-sponsored activity in a way that a press release or a public statement alone would not.  We have on occasion obtained custody of foreign criminal defendants.  Our indictments limit their travel.  And the prospect of criminal indictment can help deter some cyber actors from engaging in such conduct in the first place.  This can make it more difficult for states to recruit the manpower and resources for cyber-attacks, and raise the cost of engaging in malicious cyber activity.', \"Third, attribution through the criminal justice system is a powerful way to expose state conduct that violates norms of responsible behavior.  It complicates our adversaries' attempts to feign ignorance of illegal acts they thought could be taken in secret, or to hide behind public denials.  Our cases are governed by well-known policies relating to the conduct of all federal prosecutors.  An indictment is brought by a grand jury, under established procedures; charges are brought only when the facts and law justify it.  The allegations in our indictments are thorough and detailed, and we can prove them in a courtroom, using admissible evidence, at proof beyond any reasonable doubt.  For all these reasons, criminal indictments are among the most powerful statements we can make as a government. \", \"Fourth, unsealed indictments promote transparency.  There will always be cases in which our ability to expose malicious cyber activity is limited by our obligation to protect intelligence sources and methods or sensitive ongoing investigations.  But where we are able to do so, we strive to expose such schemes to the American people and the international community.  Attribution through detailed indictments educates the public about our adversaries' efforts and methods to spread disinformation, steal commercial technology, and target computer networks.\", 'Fifth, although our goal is to hold accountable in court those we charge with trade theft or cyber crimes, our investigations can provide critical support for the use of civil, diplomatic, economic, and military tools.  Some thoughtful critics have criticized the Department\\'s so-called \"name and shame\" strategy on the theory that our indictments have failed to stanch the activity.  But you can\\'t separate our indictments from the broader array of tools our government now uses to counter malign cyber activity.  These include freezing assets or prohibiting transactions, or adding companies to the Department of Commerce Entity List.  As the National Security Advisor has confirmed, it also includes \"undertaking offensive cyber operations\"[15] aimed at defending our national interests.  Our tools also include other authorities that can block criminals\\' assets, restrict their access to the banking system, and prohibit them from freely engaging in trade.  We developed this approach to address terrorism and terrorist financing.  We are applying it to the cyber threat, as well.', 'Finally, by using public law to emphasize the need to protect private U.S. victims against nation-state actors, we help develop the framework of public-private cooperation that is critical to cybersecurity.  The Department tries to show through our actions how we can help companies respond to nation-state threats they cannot face alone, in a way that respects their status as victims.  The Department has developed strong relationships with the private sector based on our aggressive pursuit of criminal nation-state conduct, ranging from cyber theft to information operations using third-party social media platforms.', \"No one seriously suggests that we can prosecute our way out of this problem.  But to dismiss the role that federal law enforcement plays in the government's shared fight against cyber-enabled threats is to unfairly discount--and diminish--our nation's powerful commitment to the rule of law, both within our borders and without.\", 'III.', \"Before I conclude, I'd like to briefly address one final topic.  That is the question of how we can respond to one of the latest and most potentially destabilizing manifestations of great power competition in cyberspace: our adversaries' use of covert information operations to influence, and subvert, our nation's democratic institutions, including specifically our elections. \", 'The Department of Justice has been instrumental in revealing that foreign actors create and operate false U.S. personas on internet sites designed to attract U.S. audiences, and spread divisive messages.  They also fabricate news stories in an effort to discredit American individuals or organizations.  In the process, they reach unprecedented numbers of Americans covertly, without ever setting foot on U.S. soil.', 'These deceitful actions are especially pernicious because they seek to weaponize our traditions of free speech, open inquiry, and individual conscience against us, as part of a broader project to undermine the very concept of self-government.', 'Foreign attempts to pollute our public discourse are nothing new.  These efforts have taken many forms across the decades, from covertly funding newspapers and financing front groups, to creating and spreading fake internal government communications.  One traditional response has been to require transparency.  The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), for example, requires persons who engage in certain conduct as agents of foreign principals to register with the Department of Justice, to file periodic reports thereafter, and to include a \"conspicuous statement\" disclosing that relationship on any materials disseminated by the agent on behalf of the foreign principal.  FARA\\'s purpose is to ensure that the American public and our lawmakers know the source of information that is provided at the behest of a foreign principal, where that information may be intended to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and laws.  The statute enhances the public\\'s and the government\\'s ability to evaluate such information.', 'Our recent indictments exposing Russian malign influence activity fall within the same heritage.', 'Uncovering and disclosing such malign influence activity after it has happened is not a panacea, however, especially where public disclosure of a foreign influence operation could amplify it; could create undue public alarm or confusion; or could compromise intelligence sources and methods.', 'That raises obvious questions: In defending our elections, are we limited to enforcing federal disclosure laws and other federal criminal laws that address foreign interference in our elections?  And are we limited to uncovering and disclosing such conduct only after it occurs?  Or can we take affirmative action to prevent covert, cyber-enabled foreign influence campaigns that are designed to attack and undermine our elections through the weaponization of speech?  I think the answer to that last question is yes.', 'If non-U.S. persons outside the United States are covertly interfering in our elections, whether through malicious cyber activity or covert operations using social media, the government can act to prevent that conduct consistent with the First Amendment.  The fact is, it has been settled law for over a century that non-U.S. persons located outside the United States have no rights under the First Amendment.[16]  Foreign governments similarly lack First Amendment protection.[17]', 'The more difficult question is whether hypothetical U.S. government efforts outside our borders to block or target such activity would impact the First Amendment rights of U.S. persons who are potential consumers of the covert foreign dissemination --or, for that matter, the free speech rights of U.S. persons whose own online speech may be amplified by covert foreign activity (as where covert foreign-controlled accounts disseminate the content using bots).', 'In a line of cases stretching back several decades, the Supreme Court has indicated that the First Amendment encompasses a \"right to receive\" information, that is, a right of a would-be recipient of information that is independent of any right possessed by the speaker.  Hypothetical activity by the U.S. government to prevent foreign dissemination of information to the American public could therefore implicate the First Amendment rights of U.S. citizens and residents to receive information.', \"In my view, however, such hypothetical activity would likely not violate the First Amendment where it targets messaging covertly disseminated by a foreign government and/or its agents seeking to interfere with a U.S. election, and where our government's actions are based exclusively on the (foreign) source of the information.\", 'That is because the Supreme Court precedents suggesting that Americans might have a right to receive foreign \"political propaganda\"[18] and circumscribing the government\\'s ability to \"limit[ ] the stock of information from which members of the public may draw\"[19] when making voting decisions, presuppose that the recipient can weigh the information he receives in light of the source of that information, so as \"to evaluate the import of the propaganda.\"[20]  The calculus is very different where the foreign actors have deceitfully misattributed information in a manner designed to mislead rather than inform.  The First Amendment does not provide a right to receive covert foreign propaganda.  Otherwise, disclosure statutes like FARA would be unconstitutional.', 'Hypothetical U.S. government activity would likely be consistent with the First Amendment even where it involved action to prevent foreign governments and their agents from covertly amplifying the online speech of Americans.  The speech of Americans is fully protected by the First Amendment; the government thus could not remove or impede the online communications of a U.S. person.  But such a person has no constitutional right to amplification by a foreign government, which itself is without constitutional rights.  The Department of Justice has previously expressed the view that a U.S. person has no First Amendment right to speak on behalf of a foreign nation, on the theory that the U.S. person\\'s speech in that context isn\\'t his speech at all, but rather that of \"his [foreign] master\\'s unprotected voice.\"[21]  In much the same way, a U.S. person\\'s ability to speak is not impaired by the denial of amplification from a foreign nation that lacks First Amendment rights, at least where the amplification conceals the role of the foreign nation.', 'I should emphasize that my thinking here is tentative and the context is hypothetical.  Moreover, my thinking assumes two important factors, namely, (1) hypothetical U.S. government activity would target covert acts by a foreign government and/or its agents, and (2) our activity would focus on protecting the integrity of the U.S. electoral system--though the analysis for covert foreign speech relating to political issues generally may well follow a similar track.  Under these circumstances, U.S. government activity to regulate harm from foreign misinformation would be on the most solid ground.', 'IV.', 'Let me close by emphasizing that how we respond to the challenges posed by this new era of great power competition in cyberspace will have far-reaching consequences.  As our adversaries use fraud, theft, and deception to project their power and to undermine internationally-supported norms, I am reminded of the words of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson.  Writing in the wake of the Second World War, when the global community faced a different set of emerging challenges, Justice Jackson noted that \"[w]e are put under a heavy responsibility to see that our behavior during this unsettled period will direct the world\\'s thought toward a firmer enforcement of the laws[.]\"[22] ', 'I can think of no more poetic a description of our duty today.  We, too, face an uncertain future.  And we, too, must act in accordance with law, ensuring that everything we do in these unsettled times directs the world\\'s thoughts \"toward a firmer enforcement of the laws.\" ', 'Thank you for everything you do to aid in that noble effort.', \"[1]   Daniel R.

      "['A federal grand jury returned an indictment unsealed today in Indianapolis, Indiana, charging a Chinese national as part of an extremely sophisticated hacking group operating in China and targeting large businesses in the United States, including a computer intrusion and data breach of Indianapolis-based health insurer Anthem Inc. (Anthem).', \"Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler for the Southern District of Indiana, Assistant Director Matt Gorham of the FBI's Cyber Division and Special Agent in Charge Grant Mendenhall of the FBI's Indianapolis Field office made the announcement.\", 'The four-count indictment alleges that Fujie Wang (Wang  Fu  Jie  in Chinese Hanzi), 32, and other members of the hacking group, including another individual charged as John Doe, conducted a campaign of intrusions into U.S.-based computer systems.  The indictment alleges that the defendants gained entry to the computer systems of Anthem and three other U.S. businesses, identified in the indictment as Victim Business 1, Victim Business 2 and Victim Business 3.  As part of this international computer hacking scheme, the indictment alleges that beginning in February 2014, the defendants used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization, according to the indictment.  They then installed malware and tools on the compromised computer systems to further compromise the computer networks of the victim businesses, after which they identified data of interest on the compromised computers, including personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential business information, the indictment alleges.', '\"The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history,\" said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.  \"These defendants allegedly attacked U.S. businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII.  The Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners are committed to protecting PII, and will aggressively prosecute perpetrators of hacking schemes like this, wherever they occur.\"', '\"The cyber attack of Anthem not only caused harm to Anthem, but also impacted tens of millions of Americans,\" said U.S. Attorney Minkler.  \"This wanton violation of privacy will not stand, and we are committed to bringing those responsible to justice.  I would also like to thank Anthem for its timely and substantial cooperation with our investigation.\"', '\"This case is significant not only because it showcases the FBI\\'s cyber investigative capabilities, but also because it highlights the importance of FBI and private industry relationships,\" said Assistant Director Matt Gorham.  \"Because the victim companies promptly notified the FBI of malicious cyber activity, we were able to successfully investigate and identify the perpetrators of this large-scale, highly sophisticated scheme. The FBI is committed to investigating cyber-attacks that compromise American industry and the American people. As we did in this case, we will work side by side with victim companies to ensure justice is served.\"', '\"Anthem\\'s cooperation and openness in working with the FBI on the investigation of this sophisticated cyber-attack was imperative in allowing for the identification of these individuals. This also speaks to the strong partnerships the FBI has with the private sector, as well as the tenacity and global reach of the Bureau,\" said Special Agent in Charge Grant Mendenhall.  \"It should also be noted that the speed with which Anthem initially notified the FBI of the intrusion on their networks was also a key factor in being able to determine who was responsible for the breach and should serve as an example to other organizations that might find themselves in a similar situation.\"', \"The indictment further alleges that the defendants then collected files and other information from the compromised computers and then stole this data.  As part of the computer intrusion and data breach of Anthem, the defendants identified and ultimately stole data concerning approximately 78.8 million persons from Anthem's computer network, including names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information and income data, according to the indictment. \", 'Wang and Doe are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in relation to computers and identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.', 'According to the indictment, the defendants used extremely sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses.  These techniques included the sending of specially-tailored \"spearfishing\" emails with embedded hyperlinks to employees of the victim businesses.  After a user accessed the hyperlink, a file was downloaded which, when executed, deployed malware that would compromise the user\\'s computer system by, in pertinent part, installing a tool known as a backdoor that would provide remote access to that computer system through a server controlled by the defendants.', \"The defendants sometimes patiently waited months before taking further action, eventually engaging in reconnaissance by searching the network for data of interest, according to the indictment.  This data included PII and confidential business information.  The indictment alleges that the defendants accessed the computer network of Anthem without authorization for the purpose of conducting reconnaissance on Anthem's enterprise data warehouse, a system that stores a large amount of PII, on multiple occasions in October and November 2014.\", \"The indictment further alleges that once the data of interest had been identified and located, the defendants then collected the relevant files and other information from the compromised computers using software tools.  The defendants then allegedly stole the data of interest by placing it into encrypted archive files and then sending it through multiple computers to destinations in China.  The indictment alleges that on multiple occasions in January 2015, the defendants accessed the computer network of Anthem, accessed Anthem's enterprise data warehouse, and transferred encrypted archive files containing PII from Anthem's enterprise data warehouse from the United States to China.\", \"Finally, the defendants allegedly then deleted the encrypted archive files from the computer networks of the victim businesses, in an attempt to avoid detection.  In late January 2015, the defendants deleted certain archive files containing PII that they had previously transferred from Anthem's enterprise data warehouse.\", 'Defendant Wang is specifically alleged to have controlled two domain names connected to the criminal activity.  According to the indictment, one of these domain names was associated with a backdoor used in the intrusion victimizing Victim Business 1, and the other was associated by Wang with a server used to create an email account used to conduct spearfishing attacks against employees of Victim Business 3. ', \"This case was investigated by the FBI's Indianapolis Field Office.  Senior Counsel William A. Hall, Jr. of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney and Deputy Chief of the General Crimes Unit Steven D. DeBrota of the Southern District of Indiana are prosecuting the case.  Significant assistance was provided by the Justice Department's National Security Division and the Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs.\", 'Charges contained in an indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.']\n",

      "[\"Good morning, and thank you for the invitation to return to this forum.  This conference is one of the few devoted to national security reviews of foreign investment.  It's a unique opportunity for us in the government to talk to the private sector about the threats we see and the approaches we are taking to address them, and to hear your concerns and questions in response.  The dialogue that results helps us do a better job. So thank you for being here today. \", \"As you know, the foreign investment and telecommunications landscape is rapidly changing, because of technological advancements, legal reforms, and changes in policy. There's a lot to discuss in the next two days, especially because of changes in the statutory authority underpinning CFIUS.  But before I turn to foreign investment and telecom security work, specifically, I want to take a step back and describe the larger context for that work at the Justice Department.  I want to give you a sense of how we view certain threats related to China, which, I hope, will give you a better sense of our perspective on foreign investment reviews that concern our areas of expertise and equities.  Then I will turn to the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) and how I expect it to improve how the Department conducts its reviews, better tailoring our efforts to meet modern threats and allocating resources to the most complex cases.\", 'I.          The China Initiative', 'As you may be aware, in November 2018, then-Attorney General Sessions announced a \"China Initiative\" at the Justice Department.  Attorney General Barr has indicated he supports it, and the Initiative continues under his leadership of the Department. ', \"Why has the Justice Department started a China Initiative?  Because we see increasing threats to national security from Chinese state actors, across a range of vectors.  Broadly speaking, the China Initiative aims to raise awareness of those threats, to focus the Department's resources in confronting them, and to improve our response, particularly to newer challenges. \", \"The Department's prosecutors and other lawyers have choices to make in deploying limited resources, opening and prosecuting cases, in our foreign investment reviews, and so forth.  When the Attorney General announces that certain types of cases, and certain threats, are priorities, it matters to our decisions.  And I hope it matters to the private sector, as well.\", 'A.        The Threats', 'So what do I mean by \"threats\" from China?  Let me begin with China\\'s industrial policy.  As reports by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and others have laid out, the Chinese government regards technology development as integral to its economic development and has set out an ambitious agenda to become a global leader in a wide range of technologies.  More than 100 five-year plans, science and technology development plans, and sectoral plans have issued over the last decade, all in pursuit of that objective.', 'To take one example, in 2015, China\\'s State Council released the \"Made in China 2025 Notice,\" a ten-year plan for targeting ten strategic manufacturing industries for promotion and development: (1) next generation information technology; (2) robotics and automated machine tools; (3) aircraft and aircraft components (aerospace); (4) maritime vessels and marine engineering equipment; (5) advanced rail equipment; (6) clean energy vehicles; (7) electrical generation and transmission equipment; (8) agricultural machinery and equipment; (9) new materials; and (10) biotechnology.  The program leverages the Chinese government\\'s power and central role in economic planning to alter competitive dynamics in global markets and acquire technologies in these industries.  To achieve the program\\'s benchmarks, China aims to localize research and development, control segments of global supply chains, prioritize domestic production of technology, and capture global market share across these industries. ', 'In so doing, China has committed to pursuing an \"innovation-driven\" development strategy.  But if that\\'s all the policy amounted to, we would have nothing to complain about.  No one faults a nation for aspiring to self-sufficiency in strategically important industries. ', 'The problem is not that China is working to master critical technologies, or even that it is competing with the United States, but rather the means by which it is doing so. ', '\"Made in China 2025\" is as much a roadmap to theft as it is guidance to innovate.  Since the plan was announced in 2015, the Justice Department has charged Chinese individuals and entities with trade secret theft implicating at least eight of the ten sectors.  Over a longer time period, since 2011, more than 90 percent of the Department\\'s economic espionage prosecutions (i.e., cases alleging trade secret theft by or to benefit a foreign state) involve China, and more than two-thirds of all federal trade secret theft cases during that period have had at least a geographical nexus to China.', 'Some of those cases demonstrate that China is using its intelligence services and their tradecraft to target our private sector\\'s intellectual property.  In the space of two months last year, the Department announced three cases alleging crimes by the same arm of the Chinese intelligence services, the Jiangsu Ministry of State Security, also known as the \"JSSD.\"', 'A fourth case, unsealed in December, charged two individuals with working in association with a different bureau of the Ministry of State Security to conduct a global campaign of computer intrusions targeting, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business and technological information at managed service providers (MSPs) (companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world), more than 45 technology companies in at least a dozen U.S. states, and U.S. government agencies. ', 'The group they worked for, commonly known as APT 10, targeted a diverse array of industries and technologies, including aviation, satellite and maritime technology, industrial factory automation, automotive supplies, laboratory instruments, banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, computer processor technology, information technology services, packaging, consulting, medical equipment, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas exploration and production. ', \"These techniques--covertly recruiting assets, hacking into networks--are not themselves shocking in the context of traditional espionage, the targeting of one government's secrets by another.  But this is not traditional: the concerted efforts and resources of a determined nation-state target our private sector.  \", 'Moreover, these actions are contrary to both the spirit and, in some cases, the letter, of China\\'s 2015 commitment to the international community not to steal trade secrets and other confidential business information through computer hacking \"with the intent of providing competitive advantages to [its] companies or commercial sectors.\" ', \"To be sure, there are trade secret cases where we cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Chinese government itself directed the theft.  One example was the conviction of a Chinese company--the Sinovel Wind Group Company--for stealing wind turbine technology from a U.S. company resulting in the victim losing more than $1 billion in shareholder equity and almost 700 jobs, more than half of its global workforce.  Another was the conviction of a Chinese scientist for theft of genetically modified rice seeds with biopharmaceutical applications, providing a direct economic benefit to the Chinese crop institute that was the intended recipient of the seeds.  But although we could not prove in court that these thefts were directed by the Chinese government, they are in perfect consonance with the Chinese government's economic policy.  And the absence of meaningful protections for intellectual property in China, the paucity of cooperation with any requests for assistance in investigating these cases, the plethora of state sponsored enterprises, and the authoritarian control exercised by the Communist Party--all of which create an environment where such thefts are tolerated, if not rewarded--amply justify the conclusion that the Chinese government is in some sense responsible for those thefts, too. \", 'B.        The Rule of Law', 'This brings me to another aspect of the threat we face from China: its failure to honor its commitments or to respect the rule of law and legal process more generally.', 'When a Chinese firm or individual violates American law, requests by us for documents and interviews go unanswered for years, and commitments to cooperate go unfulfilled.  In 2015, China and the United States agreed to cooperate with requests to investigate computer crime, collect electronic evidence, and mitigate malicious cyber activity emanating from their respective territories. Yet in 2017, when the Department invoked that commitment to request assistance in connection with an investigation of a purported Internet security firm for trade secret theft, we received no meaningful response. ', 'Since 2001, the United States and China have had a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement.  The Agreement creates an obligation, after one country makes a request to the other, to provide evidence gathering and other assistance \"in investigations, in prosecutions, and in proceedings related to criminal matters.\"  Over the past 10 years, however, China has rarely produced bank or similar transactional records pursuant to multiple MLA requests. And in the minority of cases where it produced records, they were incomplete, untimely, or inadmissible. And when we exercise our authorities as federal prosecutors to compel businesses located here to produce records, the Chinese government threatens them not to comply, on pain of sanctions under their laws.  ', 'We do not have an extradition treaty with China, but China by and large will not prosecute its nationals who violate our laws.  Even requests to serve the charges on the defendants, so that they may answer them in our courts under due process of law, are rebuffed. For years, we struggled to hold the Pangang Group accountable on charges that it conspired with a former employee of DuPont and others to steal the trade secrets that enable the company to make Titanium Dioxide, a compound used to color everything from house paint to food \"white.\" The Chinese government refused repeated requests to serve the charges on the Pangang entities.  Because of that recalcitrance, the Department persuaded the Supreme Court to change the applicable rule of criminal procedure to permit additional means of giving notice of charges, and federal courts have now held that Pangang Group was served. It is scheduled to stand trial early next year.', 'Even where we or our law enforcement partners obtain custody of Chinese nationals, China appears to detain foreign citizens as a means of retaliating or inflicting political pressure.  In 2014, Canadian authorities arrested a Chinese national named Su Bin at the request of the United States.  We sought his extradition for hacking-related offenses and the theft of sensitive military and export-controlled data that was sent to China.', 'In an apparent act of reprisal, Chinese authorities apprehended a Canadian couple who had lived in China for 30 years without incident.  They were accused of spying and threatened with execution.  The wife was detained for six months before being released on conditions. The husband did not meet with a lawyer for almost a year.  He was held for more than two years.', 'On the other hand, when China seeks to track down its nationals accused of political or corruption crimes, they have refused to work with U.S. authorities to bring them to justice.  Instead, it has been known to send agents known as \"Fox Hunt\" teams to the United States and elsewhere to \"persuade\" their fugitives to return to China.  The squads enter foreign countries under false pretenses, track down their fugitives and deploy intimidation tactics to force them to return to China.', 'C.        Our Strategy', 'To respond to these threats, the China Initiative establishes a number of goals and priorities. ', 'Investigating and prosecuting economic espionage and other federal crimes will remain at the heart of our work.  We will ensure that these investigations and prosecutions are adequately resourced and prioritized.  And we will continue to work with a growing list of likeminded nations to do so. But as important as they are, we must broaden our approach.  Here are three other prongs to our strategy.', \"First, criminal prosecution alone is not enough to remediate the harm caused by theft or to deter future thieves.  That's why we are looking for ways to use our tools to support those of our federal partners, including economic tools available to the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative, diplomacy by the State Department, and engagement by the military and intelligence community. \", 'A recent case is a great example of this approach.  Until recently, China did not possess the technology needed to manufacture a basic kind of computer memory, known as dynamic random-access memory (\"DRAM\").  The worldwide market for DRAM is worth nearly $100 billion, and an American company in Idaho, Micron, controls about 20 to 25 percent of that market.  In 2016, however, the Chinese Central Government and the State Council publicly identified the development of DRAM as a national economic priority and stood up a company to mass produce it. ', \"How did they set out to meet that goal?  According to an indictment unsealed in San Francisco in November, a Taiwan competitor poached three of Micron's employees, who stole trade secrets about DRAM worth up to $8.75 billion from Micron.  The Taiwan company then partnered with a Chinese state-owned company to manufacture the memory.  And in a galling twist, when Micron sought redress through the courts, the Chinese company sued Micron for infringing its patents.\", 'Our goal was not just to hold the thieves accountable: we want to ensure that Micron does not have to compete against its own intellectual property.  So, in addition to the criminal indictment, we civilly sued both the Chinese and Taiwan competitors, seeking an injunction that would bar the importation of any products based on the stolen technology into the United States.  And days before our charges were announced, the Commerce Department placed the Chinese state-owned enterprise on the Entity List, which should prevent it from acquiring the goods and services required to manufacture DRAM based on the stolen trade secrets.  Through these actions, we have sought to deprive the foreign companies of unjust enrichment, mitigating harm to Micron and, we believe, deterring similar conduct by others.', 'Second, the best strategy empowers American businesses and the private sector to defend themselves in the first place.  That is why we are equipping our U.S. Attorneys around the country with the information they need to speak about these threats to companies and others in their jurisdictions, raising awareness and developing the relationships of trust and cooperation that lead both to effective prevention and to partnerships with law enforcement in responding to incidents.', 'That is also why we need to develop enforcement strategies that target non-traditional threats in unique, sometimes sensitive contexts.   I am speaking here of non-traditional collectors, including researchers in labs, universities, and the defense industrial base, some of whom may have undisclosed ties to Chinese institutions and conflicted loyalties based on the expectation of reward through Talent Plans and other PRC incentive programs.  I am also thinking of covert efforts to influence public opinion and policy, by leveraging student groups on campus that have ties to the Chinese consulate, or American businessmen with interests in China.  Outreach and education will be critical to countering conduct that is covert, corrupt, or coercive, but for which criminal tools may not be the best, first choice.', 'Third, we must better secure our telecommunications networks from supply chain threats and guard against other national security threats through foreign investment. It is this aspect of the China Initiative that I want to spend the balance of my time on. ', 'All too often in this context, the security of a product or service, or the threat from a company that sells it, is debated as if the test is binary: whether there is proof, a \"smoking gun,\" so to speak, that the company in question is currently breaking the law by, say, conducting illicit surveillance. But whether a company has a culture that promotes theft, dishonesty, or obstruction of justice is just as relevant, because it tells you how the company will behave when it suits its interests.  ', \"Our cases show that the Chinese government will use the employees of Chinese companies doing business here to engage in illegal activity. A week ago [April 17], a former airline ticket counter agent pleaded guilty to acting as an agent of the Chinese government, without notification to the Attorney General, by working at the direction and control of military officers assigned to China's Permanent Mission to the United Nations.  During her employment at JFK with a Chinese Air Carrier, she accepted packages from PRC military officers, and placed those packages aboard Air Carrier flights to China as unaccompanied luggage or checked in the packages under the names of other passengers flying on those flights.  She encouraged other Air Carrier employees to assist the military officers, telling them that, because the Air Carrier was a Chinese company, their primary loyalty should be to China.  But covertly doing the Chinese military's bidding on U.S. soil is a crime, and the defendant and the Chinese military took advantage of a commercial enterprise to evade legitimate U.S. government oversight.  Her actions violated TSA regulations requiring checked baggage be accepted only from ticketed passengers.\", \"While there is a presumption of innocence in the criminal context, we are here today as risk managers, not criminal lawyers. We must gauge the likelihood that a company or individual will want to (or be coerced to)--and can--exploit a vulnerability, and how dire (or not) the consequences of that action are likely to be. And then we must evaluate whether there is a reliable way to lower the overall risk of those eventualities to tolerable levels.  It's more art than science, to be sure, but in making our assessments, we should consider all of the relevant evidence, including the implications of doing business in an authoritarian state.\", 'In my remarks so far, I have made the case that the Chinese government has the stated motive and intent to dominate certain, critical technologies. I have also given you examples that the PRC is using a combination of intelligence services and other hybrid techniques to target our companies to that end or exploit their presence here.  And I have described Chinese unwillingness to adhere to its stated commitments or play by reciprocal rules.  Added together, these are reasons for concern that may add up to an intolerable risk in the context of particular transactions.', \"Last July, the Administration recommended that the Federal Communications Commission deny an application by the indirect U.S. subsidiary of China Mobile Communications Corporation (a Chinese state-owned enterprise and the world's largest telecom carrier) for a license to offer international telecommunications services in the United States, under Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934. The Justice Department led the national security and law enforcement review of the application, and the Executive Branch's recommendation highlights the risks to U.S. law enforcement and national security from granting the indirect subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise the status of a common carrier provider of telecommunications services. Such a status would give China Mobile access to trusted, peering relationships with American carriers.\", 'In evaluating whether the China Mobile application was in the public interest, the Department considered a number of factors, including whether the applicant\\'s planned operations would provide opportunities to undermine the reliability and stability of our communications infrastructure, including by rendering it vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, attack, sabotage, or covert monitoring; to enable economic espionage; and to undermine authorized law enforcement and national security missions. As the recommendation puts it, in light of those factors, \"because China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government, granting China Mobile\\'s [application] in the current national security environment, would pose substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks.\"', 'Last week, we were gratified to learn that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that, in his view, \"it is clear that China Mobile\\'s application . . . raises substantial and serious national security and law enforcement risks\" and that \"approving it would [not] be in the public interest.\" He urged his fellow commissioners to reject its application at their May meeting.', 'Cases like China Mobile have brought home to the Department how important our foreign investment review work is to protecting our equities in law enforcement, counterintelligence, and telecom security.  That is why, during the first two years of this Administration, we co-led more CFIUS reviews than in the five years before that, combined.  That is why we have renamed the staff that conducts these reviews to be a \"Section,\" and reorganized its management structure, to match other operational components of NSD.  And that is why the President\\'s proposed budget for the Department would significantly increase the staff and other resources devoted to this work.', 'II.        FIRRMA', \"In doing so, we are positioning ourselves to be ready to do our part in implementing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA).  We are already working closely with the Department of the Treasury to implement the newly launched pilot program under the statute and to develop regulations to implement the Committee's expanded authority.\", \"As this room already knows, FIRRMA represents the most significant reform of the CFIUS process in more than a decade.  The Department was pleased to support the act, which adapts CFIUS to address current threats.  Most significantly, in my view, it expands the Committee's authority to address emerging national security risks that fall outside foreign control thresholds, such as minority investments that give access to sensitive information or technology, or any deal structured to circumvent CFIUS review.\", \"But FIRRMA is not just about expanding the government's power.  I believe the legislation reflects a commitment to increased transparency, predictability, and efficiency in the CFIUS process, a commitment we share.  More specifically:\", 'In these ways, FIRRMA reflects our longstanding open investment policy, makes the United States an attractive location for foreign investors, and applies neutrally to investment from any country.', 'By contrast, and as USTR has highlighted in its Section 301 reports, U.S. companies trying to enter the Chinese market must navigate foreign ownership restrictions, joint venture requirements, discriminatory licensing regimes, and vague and discretionary administrative approval processes that allow the Chinese government to pressure them to transfer their technology as a condition of market access. ', 'In seeking to protect against national security risk, we must remember that free enterprise, market incentives, and the exchange of capital, people, and ideas across borders have been critical ingredients to our economic success.  The ultimate goal of our foreign investment reviews is to preserve the framework of private choices and freedom that has made our companies and innovations the envy of the world. ', 'Along those lines, we must also work to reform the ad hoc process by which the Executive Branch advises the FCC on license applications, known as Team Telecom.  Although I am pleased with the ultimate recommendation in the China Mobile matter, which sets an important precedent, we must explore ways to make this process more efficient and expedient, so that the Executive Branch never again takes nearly seven years to make a recommendation.', 'Conclusion', 'Despite the threats and challenges we face, last year was a tremendous one for American innovation.  In 2018, U.S. companies obtained 142,000 new U.S. utility grant patents out of the more than 308,000 patents that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office approved. Six of the top 10 U.S. patent recipients were U.S. corporations.  As of 2016, industries that rely heavily on intellectual property supported at least 45 million U.S. jobs and contributed more than $6 trillion dollars to, or 38.2 percent of, U.S. gross domestic product. ', \"Last year's headlines offers examples of inventions and advances that are truly miraculous:\", 'I believe that, if we get it right---if we balance tailored authorities and a focus on national security with respect for free markets---we will continue to see unparalleled innovations like these in the United States, fueled in no small part by foreign investment. And in the coming year, I look forward to working with you to strike that balance.', ' ']\n",

USA with theft of trade secrets conspiracy, attempted theft of trade secrets, seven counts of wire fraud, and one count of obstruction of justice.  The indictment, returned by a grand jury on January 16, details Huawei's efforts to steal trade secrets from Bellevue, Washington based T-Mobile USA and then obstruct justice when T-Mobile threatened to sue Huawei in U.S. District Court in Seattle.  The alleged conduct described in the indictment occurred from 2012 to 2014, and includes an internal Huawei announcement that the company was offering bonuses to employees who succeeded in stealing confidential information from other companies.\", '\"Today we are announcing that we are bringing criminal charges against telecommunications giant Huawei and its associates for nearly two dozen alleged crimes\" Acting Attorney General Matthew G.

      "['I am honored to be joined by FBI Director Chris Wray, National Security Division Assistant Attorney General John Demers, and Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.', 'Today, the Department of Justice is announcing a criminal indictment of two computer hackers associated with the Chinese government. The charges include conspiracy to commit computer intrusions against dozens of companies in the United States and around the world.  As with all American criminal charges, individual defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.', 'This case is significant because the defendants are accused of targeting and compromising Managed Service Providers, or MSPs. MSPs are firms that other companies trust to store, process, and protect commercial data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information.  When hackers gain access to MSPs, they can steal sensitive business information that gives competitors an unfair advantage.', 'The indictment alleges that defendants worked for a group known to cyber security experts as APT-10.  These groups are designated as APTs, or Advanced Persistent Threats, because they use malware to gain access to computer networks and exfiltrate data over an extended period of time.', 'These defendants allegedly compromised MSP clients in at least a dozen countries. The victims included companies in banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining.', 'The defendants allegedly committed these crimes in association with a Chinese intelligence service known as the Ministry of State Security.', \"This is not the first time the Department of Justice has accused Chinese state actors and associates of stealing commercial information.  Since the indictment of five uniformed members of the People's Liberation Army in 2014, our Department has repeatedly cast a spotlight on Chinese state-sponsored criminal activity targeting U.S. companies.  \", \"More than 90 percent of the Department's cases alleging economic espionage over the past seven years involve China. More than two-thirds of the Department's cases involving thefts of trade secrets are connected to China.  In the last few months of this year, our Department has announced charges in three cases alleging crimes committed at the behest of a branch of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\", 'It is unacceptable that we continue to uncover cybercrime committed by China against other nations. In 2015, China promised to stop stealing trade secrets and other confidential business information through computer hacking \"with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.\"  The activity alleged in this indictment violates the commitment that China made to members of the international community.', 'We want China to cease illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community, but the evidence suggests that China may not intend to live up to its promises.', 'For example, the Chinese industrial policy, known as \"Made in China 2025,\" lists ten strategic advanced manufacturing industries that the nation has targeted for promotion and development.  Many of the companies allegedly targeted recently by Chinese defendants operate in sectors identified by that official policy.  Whether through computer hackers operating from China, or Chinese nationals recruited to steal trade secrets from companies in other countries, the goal is the same: to dominate production in strategically important industries by stealing ideas from other nations.', \"Today's charges mark an important step in revealing to the world China's continued practice of stealing commercial data.  Responding to that conduct requires a strategic approach to the threats that China poses.  That is why the Department of Justice recently announced an initiative to address the full range of threats. One tactic is to increase our enforcement efforts. Another is to conduct foreign investment reviews to protect against China improperly acquiring sensitive information. A third is to find ways to better protect our telecommunications networks.\", 'China stands accused of engaging in criminal activity that victimizes individuals and companies in the United States, violates our laws, and departs from international norms of responsible state behavior.  Exposing these actions through the criminal justice system is a valuable tool.  Faced with the detailed factual allegations released today, and the corroborating statements of other victimized nations, China will find it difficult to feign ignorance.', 'America and many allies know what China is doing. We know why they are doing it. And in some cases, we even know which individual people are doing it in association with the Chinese government.', 'The alleged criminals in this case are named Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong. We hope the day will come when the defendants face justice under the rule of law in a federal courtroom. ', \"Until then, they and other hackers who steal from our companies for the apparent benefit of Chinese industries should remember: there is no free pass to violate American laws merely because they do so under the protection of a foreign state.  The Department of Justice and the FBI will continue to use all available tools to respond to China's economic aggression and the threat that these actions pose to the prosperity and security of the United States and other nations that respect the rule of law.\"]\n"

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', \"The case unsealed today is representative of the Chinese government's trade secret theft that we see across the country and across industries.  Whether by co-opting employees, by computer intrusions or by a combination of both, agents of the Chinese government are systematically stealing our nation's intellectual property for the benefit of their own companies and their own country's strategic priorities.  To counter this activity, the Attorney General has launched a nationwide initiative, and I am honored to lead it. \", \"To glimpse the scope of the problem, just look at the recent cases that we've charged.  In the case we unsealed today, the defendants are alleged to have misappropriated the intellectual property of an American company and gone to a different company to use this privileged knowledge unlawfully, to clone a product to compete with the American product. \", 'All after the Chinese Central Government and the State Council publicly identified the development of that stolen technology as a national priority and funded a company to mass produce the cloned products.  Then to add insult to injury, the company that stole and is working to clone the legitimate American product turned around and sued the American company for violating its patents rights---which were built on the stolen technology. ', \"In addition to the criminal charges, today, for the first time ever, we also bring a civil action to stop the export of the illegal goods and prevent the Chinese company from competing with the American product in America.  And we commend the action by the Commerce Department to place the company on the Entity List, which means it won't be able to get the tools it needs to produce this product.  As this case shows, we will continue to use all available legal tools to protect American workers and American companies from illegal activity.\", 'Just two days ago, in United States v. Zhang Zhang-Gui, et al., we charged ten defendants, including co-opted company insiders, working for or acting on behalf of the Jiangsu Ministry of State Security, also known as the \"JSSD,\" an arm of the Chinese intelligence services.  According to the charging documents from the Southern District of California, the defendants conspired to hack U.S. and European defense and aerospace contractors in order to steal information to develop a Chinese version of a commercial airplane turbofan engine. ', 'Just over three weeks ago, in the Southern District of Ohio, we obtained the extradition of a JSSD intelligence officer who was also alleged to have attempted to co-opt an employee of a defense contractor in order to steal trade secrets related to commercial airplane engines. ', 'In September, in the Northern District of Illinois, we charged an individual here in the United States who acted as a source for a JSSD intelligence officer, helping him, among other things, to assess engineers and scientists for recruitment. ', 'In August, in the Northern District of New York, we charged an individual with stealing turbine technology and sending it to China. ', 'And so it goes.    ', \"Taken together, these cases, and many others like them, paint a grim picture of a country bent on stealing its way up the ladder of economic development--and doing so at American expense.  This behavior is illegal.  It's wrong.  It's a threat to our national security.  And it must stop.   \", \"The National Security Division has a variety of tools available to deal with this problem.  First, as we've talked about, we can bring prosecutions.  These prosecutions have raised the stakes for intelligence officers and their alleged co-optees here in the United States.  If you work at an American company and you help the Chinese steal its trade secrets, we will find you and prosecute you. \", 'These charges, in all their specificity, also prevent China from hiding behind their long practiced, ritualized denials and feigned ignorance. ', 'These charges also serve to educate the American public and alert U.S. business to what the Chinese government is doing on all fronts, including their efforts to target commercial technology pursuant to insiders, computer intrusions, and computer intrusions enabled by insiders. ', 'And most important, through the criminal charges, a civil suit for an injunction, an entity listing and other economic tools, the U.S. government is making a coordinated, concerted effort to deprive the thief of the benefit of his crime.', 'In addition, when the Chinese use their financial clout to buy or make strategic investments to gain access to American technology and personal data, the National Security Division will work with our partners on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to protect our sensitive technologies and data from national security risk. ', 'And when Chinese activity turns to the malign influence of American politics in order to further its economic and political agenda, we will use the Foreign Agents Registration Act and related criminal and civil tools to ensure full transparency.', \"China wants the fruits of America's brainpower to harvest the seeds of its desired economic dominance.  Preventing this from happening will take all of us, here at the Justice Department, across the U.S. government, and within the private sector.  With the Attorney General's initiative, we will confront China's malign behaviors and encourage them to conduct themselves as the leading nation they aspire to be.         \"]\n",

Billions have been invested to achieve that status.\", 'This has given this country advantages both economically and militarily that have directly benefitted the daily lives of the American people.', 'It is no surprise that geopolitical rival states around the world have taken notice.', 'That is why they often try to steal our inventions and defraud us of their proceeds.  Too often, they are successful.', 'Discoveries that took years of work and millions of dollars in investment here in the United States can be stolen by computer hackers or carried out the door by an employee in a matter of minutes. ', 'This theft is not just wrong; it poses a grave threat to our national security. And it is unlawful.', 'But under President Donald Trump, the United States is standing up to the deliberate, systematic, and calculated threats posed, in particular, by the communist regime in China, which is notorious around the world for intellectual property theft.', 'Earlier this year, a report from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer found that Chinese sponsorship of hacking into American businesses and commercial networks has been taking place for more than a decade and is a serious problem that burdens American commerce. ', \"The problem has been growing rapidly, and along with China's other unfair trade practices, it poses a real and illegal threat to our nation's economic prosperity and competitiveness.\", 'Perhaps this threat has been overshadowed in the press by threats from Russia or radical Islamic terrorism.

He left the company in 2015 and went to work for the Taiwan defendant company--from where he is alleged to have orchestrated the theft of trade secrets from Micron worth up to $8.75 billion.', 'The Taiwan defendant company then partnered with a Chinese state-owned company--so that ultimately China could steal this technology from the United States and then use it to compete against us in the market.  This is a brazen scheme.', 'If convicted, the defendants face up to 15 years in prison and $5 million in fines.  The companies could face forfeiture and fines worth more than $20 billion.', 'This week the Commerce Department added the Chinese company to the Entity List to prevent it from buying goods and services in the United States, to keep it from profiting from the technology it stole.  ', 'And today the Department of Justice is filing a civil action to seek an injunction that would prevent the Chinese and Taiwan companies from transferring the stolen technology, or exporting products based on it to the United States.', 'We are not just reacting to crimes--we are acting to block the defendants from doing any more harm to our U.S. based company, Micron.', 'United States Attorney Alex Tse of the Northern District of California will provide more information on this case in a moment.

We're not going to take it anymore.\", 'It is unacceptable.  It is time for China to join the community of lawful nations.  International trade has been good for China, but the cheating must stop. And we must have more law enforcement cooperation; China cannot be a safe haven for criminals who run to China when they are in trouble, never to be extradited. China must accept the repatriation of Chinese citizens who break U.S. immigration law and are awaiting return.', 'We will continue to charge wrongdoers based on carefully conducted investigations done with integrity and professionalism, not politics, and we will seek extradition of criminals. ', 'To be prosperous trading partners, integrity and cooperation are essential.', 'And today I am focusing more Department of Justice resources to counter these threats.', 'I am announcing that I have ordered the creation of a China Initiative led by Assistant Attorney General John Demers, who heads our National Security Division, and composed of a senior FBI Executive, five United States Attorneys including Alex, and several other Department of Justice leaders and officials, including Assistant Attorney General for our Criminal Division, Brian Benczkowski.', 'This Initiative will identify priority Chinese trade theft cases, ensure that we have enough resources dedicated to them, and make sure that we bring them to an appropriate conclusion quickly and effectively.', \"This administration's new initiative will also address two major responsibilities of our National Security Division: the Foreign Investment Review Staff's review of investments and licenses in U.S. infrastructure and telecommunications, and the Foreign Agent Registration Act Unit's work to counter covert efforts to influence our leaders and the general public.\", 'This will help us meet the new and evolving threats to our economy.  Today, we see Chinese espionage not just taking place against traditional targets like our defense and intelligence agencies, but against targets like research labs and universities, and we see Chinese propaganda disseminated on our campuses.

We are committed to continuing to work closely with our federal, state, local, and private sector partners to counter this threat from China.\"', 'According to the indictment, the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the trade secrets of Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), a leader in the global semiconductor industry specializing in the advanced research, development, and manufacturing of memory products, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).  DRAM is a leading-edge memory storage device used in computer electronics.  Micron is the only United States-based company that manufactures DRAM.  According to the indictment, Micron maintains a significant competitive advantage in this field due in large part from its intellectual property, including its trade secrets that include detailed, confidential information pertaining to the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced DRAM products. ', 'Prior to the events described in the indictment, the PRC did not possess DRAM technology, and the Central Government and State Council of the PRC publicly identified the development of DRAM and other microelectronics technology as a national economic priority.  The criminal defendants are United Microelectronics Corporation (\"UMC\"), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry; Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, Co., Ltd. (\"Jinhua\\'\"), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang, age 44.   UMC is a publicly listed semiconductor foundry company traded on the New York Stock Exchange; is headquartered in Taiwan; and has offices worldwide, including in Sunnyvale, California.  UMC mass produces integrated-circuit logic products based on designs and technology developed and provided by its customers.  Jinhua is a state-owned enterprise of the PRC, funded entirely by the Chinese government, and established in February 2016 for the sole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing DRAM.', 'According to the indictment, Chen was a General Manager and Chairman of an electronics corporation that Micron acquired in 2013.  Chen then became the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, Micron Memory Taiwan (\"MMT\"), responsible for manufacturing at least one of Micron\\'s DRAM chips.  Chen resigned from MMT in July 2015 and began working at UMC almost immediately.  While at UMC, Chen arranged a cooperation agreement between UMC and Fujian Jinhua whereby, with funding from Fujian Jinhua, UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Fujian Jinhua to mass-produce.  The technology would be jointly shared by both UMC and Fujian Jinhua.  Chen later became the President of Jinhua and was put in charge of its DRAM production facility.', 'While at UMC, Chen recruited numerous MMT employees, including Ho and Wang, to join him at UMC.  Prior to leaving MMT, Ho and Wang both stole and brought to UMC several Micron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM.  Wang downloaded over 900 Micron confidential and proprietary files before he left MMT and stored them on USB external hard drives or in personal cloud storage, from where he could access the technology while working at UMC.

', 'From at least January 2010 to May 2015, JSSD intelligence officers and their team of hackers, including  Zhang Zhang-Gui, Liu Chunliang, Gao Hong Kun, Zhuang Xiaowei, and Ma Zhiqi, focused on the theft of technology underlying a turbofan engine used in U.S. and European commercial airliners.  This engine was being developed through a partnership between a French aerospace manufacturer with an office in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China, and a company based in the United States. Members of the conspiracy, assisted and enabled by JSSD-recruited insiders Gu Gen and Tian Xi, hacked the French aerospace manufacturer.  The hackers also conducted intrusions into other companies that manufactured parts for the turbofan jet engine, including aerospace companies based in Arizona, Massachusetts and Oregon.  At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere. ', \"Defendant Zhang Zhang-Gui is also charged, along with Chinese national Li Xiao, in a separate hacking conspiracy, which asserts that Zhang Zhang-Gui and Li Xiao leveraged the JSSD-directed conspiracy's intrusions, including the hack of a San Diego-based technology company, for their own criminal ends.\", '\"For the third time since only September, the National Security Division, with its US Attorney partners, has brought charges against Chinese intelligence officers from the JSSD and those working at their direction and control for stealing American intellectual property,\" said John C.

We are working together to vigorously investigate and hold hackers accountable regardless of their attempts to hide their illicit activities and identities.\"', 'On October 10, the Department of Justice announced that a JSSD intelligence officer was extradited to the Southern District of Ohio, on charges that he attempted to steal trade secrets related to jet aircraft engines, and in September, in the Northern District of Illinois, a U.S. Army recruit was charged with working as an agent of a JSSD intelligence officer, without notification to the Attorney General. ', 'As the indictment in the Southern District of California describes in detail, China\\'s JSSD intelligence officers and hackers working at their direction masterminded a series of intrusions in order to facilitate intrusions and steal non-public commercial and other data.  The hackers used a range of techniques, including spear phishing, sowing multiple different strains of malware into company computer systems, using the victim companies\\' own websites as \"watering holes\" to compromise website visitors\\' computers, and domain hijacking through the compromise of domain registrars.

From at least November 2013 through February 2014, two Chinese nationals working at the direction of the JSSD, Tian Xi and Gu Gen, were employed in the French aerospace company's Suzhou office.  On January 25, 2014, after receiving malware from an identified JSSD officer acting as his handler, Tian infected one of the French company's computers with malware at the JSSD officer's direction. One month later, on February 26, 2014, Gu, the French company's head of Information Technology and Security in Suzhou, warned the conspirators when foreign law enforcement notified the company of the existence of malware on company systems. That same day, leveraging that tip-off, conspirators Chai Meng and Liu Chunliang tried to minimize JSSD's exposure by causing the deletion of the domain linking the malware to an account controlled by members of the conspiracy.\", \"The group's hacking attempts continued through at least May of 2015, when an Oregon-based company, which, like many of the other targeted companies, built parts for the turbofan jet engine used in commercial airliners, identified and removed the conspiracy's malware from its computer systems.\", 'Count Two of the indictment charges a separate conspiracy to hack computers in which Zhang Zhang-Gui, a defendant charged in Count One, supplied his co-defendant and friend, Li Xiao, with variants of the malware that had been developed and deployed by hackers working at the direction of the JSSD on the hack into Capstone Turbine. Using malware supplied by Zhang, as well as other malware, Li launched repeated intrusions that targeted a San Diego-based computer technology company for more than a year and a half.  These intrusions caused thousands of dollars of damage to protected computers.', 'Count Three of the indictment charges Zhang Zhang-Gui with the substantive offense of computer hacking a San Diego technology company, which was one of the targets of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Two.', 'The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. ', \"The FBI, led by the San Diego Field Office, conducted the investigation that resulted in charges announced today.  This case is being prosecuted by Alexandra Foster and Sabrina Feve of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and Jason McCullough of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.  The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs also provided assistance in this matter, and the Department appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) and the Cybercrime Section of the Paris Prosecutor's Office during the investigation of this matter.\", 'Case Number: 13CR3132-H']\n"

      "['Remarks as Prepared for Delivery', 'Thank you, to the Cybersecurity Coalition and the Cyber Threat Alliance, for the invitation to speak at CyberNext DC. ', 'When I was preparing my remarks, I noticed that the theme of the conference is \"Privacy, Partnerships, Protection.\" That\\'s a helpful framework for my remarks today, because I want to talk about all three of those. ', 'Protection', \"I will start with protection, which is at the core of law enforcement's mission. Investigating crimes, building cases, and holding individuals, entities, and even nations, accountable, is a large part of how the Justice Department protects the public and contributes to cybersecurity. \", 'It is fairly straightforward why: criminal prosecution is a means of reinforcing the difference between right and wrong, between acceptable state behavior, on the one hand, and that which violates accepted norms of conduct on the Internet. ', 'And imposing consequences, whether through imprisonment, fines or sanctions, or other tools, is a way of deterring malicious conduct, by raising its costs (personal, reputational, financial, and otherwise). As the First Pillar of the Administration\\'s recent National Cyber Strategy puts it, \"Law enforcement actions to combat criminal cyber activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring those activities.\"', \"The last year has seen significant prosecutions of foreign hackers, including those acting on behalf of foreign governments, for computer intrusions and attacks. It is worth recounting some of them, for what they show about the Department's priorities and the lengths we will go in doing our part to enforce the law and protect the public.\", 'Boyusec', 'In October 2017, the Department announced charges against three Chinese nationals and residents who worked for a purported Internet security firm known as Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited (a/k/a \"Boyusec\"). ', 'The defendants are accused of computer hacking and trade secret theft between December 2015 and March 2016. Among other things, the indictment alleges they stole a prominent economist\\'s e-mail messages and trade secrets related to global navigation technology that \"had no military application,\" but was marketed to construction, land survey, and agricultural sectors. ', 'Now, the Indictment does not allege action by the Chinese state. But what made the defendants\\' alleged trade secret theft notable (besides the fact that they worked for a firm that marketed its cybersecurity services), was that it continued after China committed in September 2015 (1) not to steal trade secrets or confidential business information \"with the intent of providing competitive advantages\" to its own companies, and (2) to cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes emanating from its territory, which this did. ', 'The September 2015 commitment ushered in broad, public acceptance of a norm against computer espionage for economic benefit (soon accepted by all of the other members of the G-20). And it was incumbent on the U.S. government to hold China to the commitments it made.', 'As we previously revealed, the Boyusec indictment was returned under seal, while we sought China\\'s assistance in investigating and putting a stop to Boyusec\\'s activities.  When we received \"no meaningful response\" to those requests, there was no longer a basis to keep the charges sealed, and we made them public.', \"Thereafter, the U.S. Trade Representative cited the Boyusec indictment in its March 2018 study of China's trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which concluded that a combination of China's practices are unreasonable, including its outbound investment policies and sponsorship of unauthorized computer intrusions. \", \"In this way, you can draw a direct line from the DOJ's indictment of China's military officers in 2014, through China's commitments in 2015, to our monitoring for compliance with those commitments, and this Administration's response to China's economic aggression, which includes state-sponsored theft of intellectual property.\", 'Mabna Institute', 'In March of 2018, the Department announced charges against nine Iranian nationals associated with the Mabna Institute in Iran for a massive coordinated hacking campaign that targeted intellectual property and other research at more than 300 colleges and universities around the world.', 'The very purpose of the Mabna Institute, according to the indictment, was to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations obtain access to scientific resources outside Iran. It contracted with the Iranian government (including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.) as well as private organizations, and it sold some of the stolen data on websites marketed to Iranian customers.', 'The indictment alleges the campaign was executed in three phases:', ' ', \"Over the course of four years, the Mabna Institute and these nine individuals are accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data, intellectual property, and communications.  That amounts to 7.75 trillion sheets of paper. (And that's printing double-sided.) U.S. universities had collectively spent $3.4 billion to have access to that intellectual property. \", 'The charges themselves virtually guarantee the defendants cannot leave Iran without arrest. And on the day they were announced, the Department of the Treasury, leveraging our investigation, sanctioned the Mabna Institute and the defendants \"for engaging in malicious cyber-enabled activities related to the significant misappropriation of economic resources or personal identifiers for private financial gain,\" under a provision of Executive Order 13694 (2015).', 'DPRK', \"In September, the Department unsealed a massive complaint, outlining some of the government's proof behind its prior, higher-level attribution that North Korea launched a destructive malware attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, stole $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 (and attempted to steal at least $1 billion from other banks), and created the malware used in the WannaCry 2.0 global ransomware attack last year. \", 'The complaint lays out more than 170 pages of evidence that a single conspiracy, backed by the North Korean government, was responsible for those crimes among others, and it identifies one of the men who was a member of that conspiracy.', \"As the complaint makes clear, however, the U.S. government was not alone in this investigation.  The complaint cites to security researchers whose expertise and dogged pursuit of the threat was critical to the allegations of the complaint. Our investigative efforts not only validate theirs, they yield specific information that expanded the security community's understanding of the Lazarus Group (a popular name for the intrusion set) and how best to protect against it.\", 'USADA, et al.', \"Finally, this brings me to this morning's announcement of an indictment in Pittsburgh (where the first public national security cyber case was unsealed in 2014).  \", 'A grand jury there has indicted seven Russian GRU officers with an international hacking conspiracy targeting international anti-doping organizations, among others. ', \"Among the conspiracy's goals: to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize those organizations, which had publicly exposed Russia's state-sponsored athlete doping program; and to damage the reputations of athletes around the world by falsely claiming that such athletes were using banned or performance-enhancing drugs. \", 'The indictment also alleges how, when the efforts to obtain remote access failed to achieve their objectives, the GRU sent several of the defendants to locations where their targets were physically located. Then, using specialized equipment, those close access teams hacked the WiFi networks used by the victim organizations or their personnel (like hotel networks where they were staying).', 'There are some who question this approach, of criminally investigating and charging hackers sponsored by foreign states, often because we have not yet arrested the defendants I have described above. ', 'It is probably easy to forget that, until relatively recently, such charges were unheard of, because for a long time, we viewed the problem of foreign state-sponsored hacking through the lens of intelligence collection alone, without regard to disruption and deterrence (which are our objectives in confronting terrorism, espionage, and other challenging national security threats). ', 'But imagine a world in which there are no criminal charges, no detailed, formal allegation of wrongdoing (which the government is prepared to stand behind in court). The private sector would be left alone to accuse the guilty, without recourse.  What message does that send to a foreign hacker? ', \"Certainly not the same message we have sent to Karim Baratov, the 23-year-old hacker who worked with FSB officers to hack into e-mail accounts around the world, who was recently sentenced to five years' imprisonment after being arrested in Canada and waiving extradition.  Or to Ardit Firizi, the Kosovar who was arrested in Malaysia, pled guilty here, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for giving ISIS PII for 1,300 military and government personnel, which he stole from the network of a U.S. retailer. Or to countless other hackers arrested on purely criminal charges, who thought they were safe from the consequences for their actions, because they operated under regimes that ignored (if not sponsored) their crimes.\", 'And even in the cases above (where we have yet to apprehend a defendant), the charges were never the end of the story: whether it is trade remedies, sanctions, contributions to network defense, or diplomatic efforts to rally likeminded nations to confront an adversary together, all of those charges served a greater purpose.', 'Privacy', 'So often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But each of the cases I described vindicates the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets, or of professors to prevent their hard-earned research from being stolen, preempted, and plagiarized; the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications or our medical records.', \"Privacy isn't dead, but it is under attack, and much of what we are doing through law enforcement honors the privacy of innocent persons, by investigating those who would breach it. As the Sony case as well as the GRU cases illustrate, data breaches are not just trees that fall in forests when no one else is around; their consequences are often painfully visible to their victims (and the rest of the world).\", \"But leaving aside these examples of DOXing, I want to shift gears for a moment, to talk about the Department of Justice's changing approach to personal privacy, and why the privacy of your personal information can be a matter of national security.\", 'This portion of my remarks comes from a different vantage point, from my experience with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (or CFIUS), where I represent the Department.', 'Now CFIUS, for those of you who are not familiar, is a committee of federal departments that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses for national security risk. When it finds risks that cannot be mitigated, it recommends actions to the President, who has the authority to prohibit a transaction.', 'CFIUS does not review the vast majority of foreign investments in the United States. Even among those transactions we do review, we usually conclude that there are no unresolved national security concern.', \"A classic example of the risk CFIUS examines arises when the target of an acquisition is in close proximity to a DOD facility. But an increasing focus of DOJ's work on the committee relates to data security, to the potential national security consequences of personal information ending up in the wrong hands. The kind of information I am talking about is collected every day, from thousands or even millions of consumers. Transaction information, PII, health information, even smartphone habits.\", 'Now you might ask why the security of that kind of consumer data would be relevant to CFIUS, whose mission is to protect national security. And ten years ago, or so, such information did not seem like it would be. But a few things have changed.', 'First, the volume and variety of data has increased exponentially. Information that was not previously stored in a digital form now is. And the rate at which data are being created, the velocity of data growth, is increasing.', 'Consider the increasing connectedness of physical devices and sensors, often referred to as the Internet of Things. Everything from medical devices, such as pacemakers, to fitness trackers, to the control systems that deliver water and power to our businesses and homes. One estimate predicts the number of Internet-connected devices will reach more than 20 billion by 2020.  These Internet-connected devices have increased the volume, variety, and velocity of information. ', 'Take cars, for example. Not long ago, a car was essentially a mechanical device, an engine with seats that moved you from point A to point B. Whatever limited electronic components it had were self-contained.', \"Today's cars, by contrast, contain communication devices, sensors, GPS navigation, and other computers with a variety of functions. They allow drivers to check fuel levels and tire pressure on their cell phones, track a stolen vehicle over the Internet, call for help from the car in an emergency, and access the same entertainment they're used to enjoying in their home.\", 'Another example: the universe of health information is rapidly expanding.  More people are taking advantage of DNA testing to learn about their health, longevity, paternity, and ancestry.  According to one 2017 report, the market for testing has become an $830 million industry. Meanwhile, our smartphones and watches are accruing ever more precise information about our health and habits.', 'New forms and pools of data merely add to what has been collected for years, and it remains possible for a determined adversary to steal it, given enough time and resources.', 'A second insight we have developed is that information that seems unimportant, or purely personal, or irrelevant, can, in fact, be used to threaten national security.', 'In January, a 20-year-old Australian student discovered that open source maps of where Fitbit and other fitness device users frequently go could be used to identify military facilities in remote areas.  As the Washington Post put it, \"In war zones and deserts in countries such as Iraq and Syria, the heat map becomes almost entirely dark -- except for scattered pinpricks of activity. Zooming in on those areas brings into focus the locations and outlines of known U.S. military bases, as well as other unknown and potentially sensitive sites -- presumably because American soldiers and other personnel are using fitness trackers as they move around.\"', 'Some data might be valuable, in and of themselves, like a military secret or the admin password to an industrial control system. But other data are valuable because they are part of what a hacker or other malicious actor needs to achieve their objective, to get to their target. ', \"The information a modern car collects provides insight into the users' network of contacts, entertainment preferences, driving habits, and locations visited on a regular basis.\", 'In the aggregate, this information provides commercial and cultural insights that might have monetary or other use. But this information about the \"pattern of life\" of a company\\'s CEO or government official could also be used to target that individual.', \"By themselves, the music you favor, your children's birthdates, your anniversary, and the addresses you've lived at--these are not national security secrets.\", 'But with that information, a criminal hacker could answer password reset questions or use a password cracker to obtain control of your accounts. And even if it is a personal (as opposed to a professional) account, and I might not care about the last photo you posted from your vacation, masquerading as you online makes it that much easier to trick the people who know you into clicking on a link or otherwise compromising their network security.', \"Our third insight is this: the fact that most people in a data set might not be targets themselves (in fact, that only a few might be) provides little comfort. Anyone on any form of social media has learned that we are more connected than it seems. In 2016, Facebook reported that its American users were separated by fewer than 3.5 degrees of separation on average. Extrapolating what that means offline, anyone's information can be useful more for what it tells us about her brother, the CISO at a major bank, or her aunt in the intelligence community.\", 'Our concerns are exacerbated by the fact that traditional methods of de-identification of data (such as anonymization or encryption of content) may be defeated, by, for example, sensor and geolocation data, or by cross-referencing sanitized data sets against others. ', 'Researchers from two studies several years ago reported that, with a sufficient pool of data, they could distinguish a unique user of a cellphone, or a credit card, based on just four geolocations or transactions, respectively, with at least 90 percent accuracy. I cannot vouch for the methodology of those studies, but they give me pause when I think about the potential that nefarious actors could have access to large pools of such data without legal process. ', 'What does this mean for companies, and the way they should think about their data?', 'First, and most important, they should not assume that hackers are not interested in the data or that it cannot be used to threaten national security.', 'Second, cybersecurity policies and practices need to keep pace as businesses grow and deploy new technologies, such as biometric identification or artificial intelligence.', 'Third, joint ventures or other arrangements with foreign parties may provide network access or other elements of control over data. Businesses should consider the ways an aggressive foreign intelligence service could exploit that data, in light of other data it might have from other sources.', 'Fourth, and finally, report computer intrusions, because the breach you think is merely a private matter, may in fact be a matter of national security.', 'Partnerships', 'This brings me to the final theme, partnerships. The cases we bring require true partnerships, between law enforcement and the victims who cooperate with us; between us and the intelligence community and other components of the government; and, increasingly, between our government and the governments of likeminded nations, whether in gathering and sharing information, validating our conclusions, extraditing defendants, or imposing other consequences. ', \"But as much as I believe in the value of criminal prosecutions, we have always known that we will not prosecute our way to cybersecurity. The partnership that may be most critical to our future is among the professionals in and out of government who share common goals. Which is why one of the National Security Division's greatest successes this year did not result in a criminal charge.\", 'In May, agents of the FBI were tracking a virulent botnet infecting home and office routers around the world, attributed to the same group responsible for today\\'s indictment, known to some as \"Fancy Bear.\" ', 'The botnet was growing at an alarming rate by that point, and private sector researchers studying it told us they felt an increasing urgency to publish what they knew, so that affected router manufacturers, ISPs, and others could take steps to protect the public before it was too late. ', \"There was no easy technical solution to this pernicious malware. Its second stage (which could steal information and even brick the device) could be cleared from memory with a simple restart, but if a router were infected, complete mitigation could be virtually impossible, short of replacement, because the first stage of malware (the actors' toe-hold in the system) would just call out for instructions to reinfect. \", 'With no time to waste, in little more than a week (including late nights and a weekend), agents and prosecutors devised the best mitigation plan they could under the circumstances.', 'In a coordinated action,', \"Researchers drew attention to the botnet at the same time that the FBI executed the orders and blasted out a public service advisory to restart your router, purging the second stage of malware and causing the first stage to call out for instructions, now to the FBI's server, so that help could be alerted. These efforts were our best effort to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available, before Fancy Bear actors learned of the vulnerabilities in the C2 infrastructure through the research firm's imminent announcement.\", 'Last week, Cisco Talos, the research firm I mentioned, published a follow-up to its original report. It found that the VPNFilter malware possessed even greater capabilities than previously identified, in the form of third-stage malware modules that provide additional capabilities to map networks, exploit systems connected to infected devices, and obfuscate or encrypt malicious traffic.', 'But Cisco Talos also reported, based on information from partners as well as its own analysis, that \"it appears that VPNFilter has been entirely neutralized since\" the effort I described earlier by a coalition of international partners (which included the Cyber Threat Alliance). So far, they said, there have been no signs of the actors attempting to reconnect with the devices that remain infected with the pernicious first stage of the malware. Not bad, for the first (but I promise you, not the last) effort to mitigate a botnet tied to nation-state actors.', 'Once, there was no one. Attribution was whispered in classified channels alone. We spoke, haltingly at first, of cyber threats \"emanating from Asia.\" Then the U.S. led the way, calling out the malicious behavior of specific foreign states, first in speeches, then by indictment.', 'Today, we are joined by three other nations in attributing specific conduct to Russia.', 'I cannot tell you where our commitment to partnership will take us next. But I can tell you, based on this, that there is reason for hope, and to continue working together to maintain an \"open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.\"']\n",

', 'We have violent gangs terrorizing communities across our country.', \"Criminals in the United States and overseas are targeting Americans in financial fraud schemes that destroy people's hard earned savings, often taking a particular toll on our seniors.\", 'Cyber criminals are stealing our private information, hacking into our online accounts, and stealing intellectual property from our businesses.', 'And criminals are coming up with new schemes every day to steal taxpayer dollars from our federal health care programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, and the TRICARE program that provides healthcare to our military families.', 'But we are making progress.', 'Under the leadership of President Trump and Attorney General Sessions, we are taking an all-hands approach to law enforcement.', 'Last June, Attorney General Sessions announced the largest surge in federal prosecutors in decades.  Across the country, we are hiring more federal prosecutors, including right here in Alaska.', 'In the Criminal Division at the Justice Department, where I work, we recently marked a particularly important milestone--our Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, was just confirmed by the U.S. Senate a few weeks ago.  ', \"Under his leadership, we will continue the Division's commitment to the rule of law and protecting our citizens, working more closely than ever with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners.\", \"Partners like the Coast Guard, which under Admiral Shultz is our primary defense to drug smuggling on the high seas and which works closely with DOJ's Narcotic and Dangerous Drugs Section.\", \"DOJ is working with State Attorneys General, like Jahna Lindemuth, not only to investigate and prosecute cases, but also to educate the public and prevent crime through programs such as our Elder Justice Initiative.  Under that initiative, which was announced by Attorney General Sessions in February, we now have an Elder Justice Coordinator in each of our 93 U.S. Attorney's Offices, including here in Alaska.\", \"I know this is a particularly important issue for U.S. Attorney Schroder as well, who has made it a priority to prosecute elder fraud cases, working together with FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the State of Alaska's Office of Elder Fraud and Assistance.\", 'Just this past December, his office secured a 10-year sentence against a Washington State man who defrauded Alaskans out of approximately 2.7 million dollars as part of an advance-fee scheme that preyed upon the sick and elderly.', 'In connection with the focus on elder justice that I just mentioned, this February Attorney General Sessions announced the coordination of a nationwide elder fraud sweep that involved approximately 200 criminal defendants who were engaged in a variety of fraud schemes, ranging from mass mailing to telemarketing and investment scams, targeting seniors in Alaska and around the nation.', \"In my current role as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Department's Criminal Division, I am tasked with overseeing the Organized Crime and Gang Section.  I'm in a position to see all of the great work that our 700 federal prosecutors in the Criminal Division are doing each day to protect the American people across the country, often with prosecutors in U.S. Attorney's Offices, and with federal, state and local law enforcement, to bring violent gang members to justice--members of gangs like MS-13.\", \"Fighting violent crime is a top priority of this Attorney General and this Administration--and I know it's a priority for all of our citizens, and particularly for the people of Alaska.  Between 2014 and 2016, the national violent crime rate increased by around seven percent, and the murder rate went up by roughly 20 percent.  As of the most recent FBI statistics, in 2016, Alaska had the highest rate of violent crime per capita of any state at approximately 800 offenses per 100,000 persons.\", \"Under U.S. Attorney Schroder, the U.S. Attorney's Office here has doubled down in its efforts against violent crime.  Bottom line is that Bryan's office went from 154 violent crime cases filed in calendar year 2016, to 186 cases filed in calendar year 2017.  That's a 20.7 percent increase.  The number of defendants charged went up even more, from 198 in calendar year 2016, to 243 in calendar year 2017, a 22.7 percent increase.  \", 'In October last year, he announced the Office\\'s Anti-Violent Crime Strategy, which brings together city, state, and federal authorities to combat rising crime in Alaska.  He did it as part of the Attorney General\\'s October 2017 renewal of \"Project Safe Neighborhoods,\" a nationwide program that partners federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.', \"A key part of the anti-violent crime strategy here in Alaska involves greater collaboration with local law enforcement.  Here in Anchorage, the FBI has assigned a Special Agent to work full time with the Anchorage Police Department's homicide unit.\", 'The Anchorage Police Department is also using the Integrated Ballistic Identification System, a national system hosted by the ATF that allows local law enforcement to quickly enter ballistics information and search against evidence from their jurisdiction, neighboring ones, and others across the country.', \"I'd like to switch gears now and address a few of the other significant threats to public safety and public health that Attorney General Sessions has made a priority for federal prosecutors.\", 'Health Care Fraud.', \"We're working to protect the federal health care system that benefits Alaskans and all Americans.  The success of the Department's approach to health care fraud was on full display a few weeks ago when Attorney General Sessions and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Azar announced the largest ever health care fraud enforcement action in history.\", \"This year's takedown involved charges against 601 defendants across 58 federal districts, including 165 doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in health care fraud schemes involving more than $2 billion in false billings.  These are cases that impact every American taxpayer.  When a criminal in Miami steals money from Medicare, it impacts taxpayers in Anchorage.\", 'As a result of our focus on health care fraud, in Miami and Detroit, we have seen a 20 percent drop in Medicare Part A and B billings.  That amounts to over $2 billion in savings for all taxpayers annually.', 'Just as important as the fraud charges, 162 defendants, including 57 medical professionals, were charged for their roles in prescribing and distributing opioids and other dangerous narcotics.', 'The opioid epidemic has hit Alaska hard.', \"Admissions for treatment of opioid abuse increased almost 60 percent in 2014.  Recent data show that over 200,000 Alaskans out of a state population of around 740,000, obtained prescriptions Schedule 2 controlled substances, including opioids--that's 27 percent of the population.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, approximately 80 percent of heroin users reported starting their addiction with these kinds of prescription opioid painkillers.   \", \"While the majority of those opioids were initially prescribed in good faith by doctors trying to do right by their patients, the data indicate that there is unfortunately no shortage of medical professionals only too willing to prescribe opioids for any reason, or for no reason all--and that's a crime.  \", 'By investigating and prosecuting corrupt doctors and pharmacists who are illegally prescribing and distributing prescription opioids, we can stem the flow of these dangerous narcotics onto our streets.  As we reduce the flow of prescription opioids, we seek to prevent the next generation of addicts.', 'We are also attacking other cases involving opioids, including by charging suppliers in China who are manufacturing deadly fentanyl that is being sold over the internet to people in the United States.', 'And we continue our work in dismantling drug trafficking organizations and cartels that continue to flood our streets with deadly poisons here and in the lower 48.', \"On the cyber and child exploitation front, in April of this year, the Department announced charges against seven individuals and the seizure of Backpage.com, the internet's leading forum for prostitution ads, including ads advertising the prostitution of children.  Backpage was allegedly used as a platform that allowed human traffickers to thrive.\", 'Also this year, prosecutors in our Organized Crime and Gang section charged 36 cybercriminals from the United States and 17 countries on five continents who participated in a transnational cyber enterprise called \"Infraud.\" ', 'Members of the Infraud Organization used the forum to coordinate and conduct online criminal activities that included identity theft, bank fraud, wire fraud and computer crimes, resulting in more than $530 million in losses to financial institutions, merchants, and private individuals in all 50 states.', 'Our prosecutors work day and night, across the country, side by side with our law enforcement partners, as we tackle these problems that are so important to the Department, the people of Alaska, and the nation.', 'While many of our investigations are taken out of the public eye, know that we are here, we are dedicated, and we will not waiver in our mission of protecting the American public.  Our goal is simple--we will use every lawful tool available to ensure that our citizens, our businesses, and our country can thrive, without fear of crime.', \"As federal prosecutors, we are not here to fill up the prisons or manage crime -- that's not our goal.

      "[\"A manufacturer and exporter of wind turbines based in the People's Republic of China was sentenced today for stealing trade secrets from AMSC, a U.S.-based company formerly known as American Superconductor Inc., announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John P.

Blader for the Western District of Wisconsin. \", \"The Court found that AMSC's losses from the theft exceeded $550 million, and imposed the maximum statutory fine in the amount of $1.5 million on Sinovel Wind Group LLC.  The Court found that the parties settled the restitution amount, and imposed a year of probation until Sinovel pays the full restitution amount.  Sinovel has paid $32.5 million to AMSC this week and will pay $25 million within its year of probation.  Sinovel will also pay $850,000 to additional victims within its year of probation.

AMSC developed the technology - software that regulates the flow of electricity from wind turbines to electrical grids - in Wisconsin and elsewhere.  At the time of the theft in March 2011, Sinovel had contracted with AMSC for more than $800 million in products and services to be used for the wind turbines that Sinovel manufactured, sold, and serviced. ', \"Sinovel was charged on June 27, 2013, along with Su Liying, the deputy director of Sinovel's Research and Development Department; Zhao Haichun, a technology manager for Sinovel; and Dejan Karabasevic, a former employee of AMSC Windtec Gmbh, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMSC.  The evidence presented at trial showed that Sinovel conspired with the other defendants to obtain AMSC's copyrighted information and trade secrets in order to produce wind turbines and to retrofit existing wind turbines with AMSC technology without paying AMSC the more than $800 million it was owed and promised.  Through Su and Zhao, Sinovel convinced Karabasevic, who was head of AMSC Windtec's automation engineering department in Klagenfurt, Austria, to leave AMSC Windtec, to join Sinovel, and to steal intellectual property from the AMSC computer system by secretly downloading source code on March 7, 2011, from an AMSC computer in Wisconsin to a computer in Klagenfurt.  Sinovel then commissioned several wind turbines in Massachusetts and copied into the turbines software compiled from the source code stolen from AMSC.  The U.S.-based builders of these Massachusetts turbines helped bring Sinovel to justice.  Su and Zhao are Chinese nationals living in China, and Karabasevic is a Serbian national who lived in Austria, but now lives in Serbia.    \", 'According to evidence presented at trial, following the theft, AMSC suffered severe financial hardship.  It lost more than $1 billion in shareholder equity and almost 700 jobs, over half its global workforce.', \"The case was investigated by the FBI's Madison Resident Agency, Milwaukee Field Office, and the FBI's Boston Field Office; this investigation was supported by an international team of FBI personnel, including agents and analysts stationed at FBI Legal Attache Offices in Vienna, Austria and Beijing, China; and the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program within the Criminal Investigative Division; the Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Criminal Intelligence Service) and the Bundesministerium Fuer Justiz (Federal Ministry of Justice) in Austria; the Landeskriminalamt - Klagenfurt and the Staatsanwaltschaft - Klagenfurt (Criminal Investigative Police and State Prosecutor's Office - Klagenfurt, Austria); and with the assistance of the Justice Department's Office of International Affairs and the Cybercrime Laboratory of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). \", \"Senior Counsel Brian L. Levine of CCIPS and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy M. O'Shea and Darren C.

      "['Good afternoon, and thank you for inviting me here to share a few words on the importance of collaboration in confronting the national security cyber threat. ', 'Protecting the nation from national security threats is the mission of the National Security Division.  Although NSD was created in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks, its mission goes well beyond terrorism.  In the past years it has come increasingly to include a focus on cyber as part of the threat posed by certain foreign nations.  And as we do with respect to terrorism, NSD drives collaboration among prosecutors, law enforcement officials, intelligence attorneys and the Intelligence Community to ensure that we approach the national security cyber threat using every tool and resource available to the federal government.', \"Some of you in this room come from the private sector -- companies both large and small.  Companies that consult and provide advice, and companies that manufacture products.  Others come from federal, state and local governments -- or from other countries.  Your work may be diverse, but you all appreciate one thing.  You know that there are countries in this world that want what we have.  They want our sensitive information, our technology, our intellectual property.  And they want to destroy any competitive advantage we enjoy.  Around the world there are people who wake up every morning thinking about how they're going to destroy it.  And they go to bed at night, much too often, thinking about a job well done.   One thing they're not spending much time thinking about is our laws and international cyber norms. \", \"You don't have to be a defense contractor to be worried about this.  Recently, we prosecuted cases involving the thefts of grains of rice and kernels of corn.  No one is immune.  If you're in business, if you're in government, if you're in medicine or academic research, you have something of value to someone else.  And to get it, foreign countries will use all means, including computer intrusions. \", \"You are not going to stop these countries on your own.  No private company or institution has the resources of a determined nation state.  Nor is any one part of the federal government going to stop these adversaries on its own.  We'll only succeed in defending the nation's firepower and the fruits of its brain power if we're partnered together. \", 'In recent years, NSD has furthered the government\\'s efforts to deter and disrupt malicious national security cyber threats by charging hackers acting on behalf of China, Russia, Iran and Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).  But not every cyber disruption needs to be a prosecution.  In fact, just last week, the Department announced it obtained a court order to disrupt a global botnet known as the \"VPNfilter\" that had infected hundreds of thousands of home and office routers controlled by the Sofacy Group, a well-known malicious cyber-hacking organization.  The botnet provided the Sofacy Group ability to undertake all manner of malicious cyber activity, from unlawful surveillance to theft of valuable information to disruptive attacks.  The Department could not have begun to neutralize this threat alone.  We worked closely with the private sector, including private security researchers, and other government partners, such as the Department of Homeland Security.  If we continue to work together, we will do much, much more.', 'Let me provide two other illustrations of the good that can happen when the private sector and the government work together.', \"Let's take the case of Yahoo.  Yahoo was the victim of a breach in 2013, only to discover three years later that it had been subject to a second, massive breach in 2014.  When this information came to light, Yahoo notified the government and provided valuable assistance to the FBI, fully cooperating at every stage of the investigation.\", 'As a result of this effective collaboration, Yahoo and the FBI determined that hackers, working both for financial gain and on behalf of Russian intelligence officers, had stolen information from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts, and used that stolen information to obtain access to the contents of accounts hosted by Yahoo, Google and other providers.  Russian journalists, U.S. and Russian government officials, and private-sector employees of financial, transportation and other companies had all been targeted. ', 'Thanks to the close cooperation of Yahoo, Google and others, DOJ prosecutors and the FBI were able to identify and expose the hackers without further compromising the privacy of the account holders.  Three of the defendants were Russian nationals residing in Russia -- two Federal Security Service or \"FSB\" agents and a known Russian hacker, an FBI \"Most Wanted Cyber Criminal,\" Alexsey Belan. ', 'The fourth defendant was a 22-year-old hacker named Karim Baratov, who resided in Canada.  Following the U.S. indictment, Canada captured and arrested Baratov.  He was brought to the U.S. and pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts, including conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and aggravated identity theft.  Earlier this week, he was sentenced to five years in jail.', 'The second case demonstrates that cooperating with the government, and benefiting from its knowledge and tools, can help a company that has been hacked, see things for what they really are. ', 'A few years ago, a Midwestern consumer goods company was the victim of what appeared to be a \"run of the mill\" intrusion.  An intruder had obtained unauthorized access to their customer database and had obtained personally identifiable information for their customers.  The company\\'s IT personnel worked diligently to eject the hacker from their network, but he kept coming back.  Eventually, the hacker threatened to expose the company\\'s customer information unless he was paid a ransom.', 'Around that time, the company connected with the FBI. ', \"The FBI determined that Ardit Ferizi, a Kosovo citizen studying computer science in Malaysia, was one of the hackers who had gained unauthorized access to the victim company's PII.  \", 'Although the hacker had a financial motive in demanding a ransom from the company, the customer PII Ferizi stole was not destined for the black market; that data was of interest because, among the tens of thousands of customer names and email accounts he stole, there were more than a thousand email addresses that ended in \".gov\" or \".mil.\"', 'Ultimately, Ferizi used that information to produce a list of PII for approximately 1,300 U.S. government civilian employees and U.S. military personnel.', 'He provided this information to a Syrian-based ISIS member named Junaid Hussain.', 'A few months earlier, Hussain, acting in the name of the Islamic State Hacking Division, had posted a \"kill list\" that purported to include the names and addresses of 100 members of the U.S. military.  Ferizi wanted to help him create and disseminate a second kill list.', 'And in fact, soon after he received the information from Ferizi, Hussain used Twitter to publish the PII of all 1,300 U.S. government and military customers of the company.  In his tweet, he threatened \"the Crusaders\" who were conducting a \"bombing campaign against the Muslims.\"', 'The Department of Justice charged Ferizi with violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and with conspiring to provide material support to ISIS.  We were successful in obtaining his extradition from Malaysia to the United States, and he ultimately pleadded guilty. ', 'In September 2016, Ferizi was sentenced to 20 years in prison.  He was also ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution to the company.', 'Even though the prosecution of Ferizi was public, the name of the company was never revealed.   ', 'We are often asked why we would bring a case against foreign nationals located outside the U.S.  Well for one, as the Yahoo and Ferizi cases prove, we may well get one or more of them.  The U.S. government has extradition agreements with more than 100 countries, so it is not enough for these defendants to forego a visit to Disney World.  For the rest of their lives they will be unable to travel to more than half the countries in the world without fear of arrest and extradition to the U.S. ', \"Second, the investigation and charges can assist other parts of the Government in bringing their authorities to bear.  For instance, Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control can designate the charged individuals or entities under an Executive Order that authorizes blocking the property of persons engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities -- ensuring that the perpetrators will be financially isolated from the world.  When we brought charges against the founders and employees of the Iranian Mabna Institute that hacked more than 300 American and foreign universities, and government agencies and institutions around the world, Treasury also designated the Institute and ten Iranian individuals. \", \"Third, charges raise awareness, both generally and specifically, to this threat.  In some cases there may be additional victims that don't know they've been hacked.  To help the private sector identify malicious activity and better protect itself, the FBI and DHS will often release technical details to the public. FBI did that just last week, when it released a Public Service Announcement about VPNFilter, advising you to reboot your router and including signatures of the botnet's malware, so network defenders can identify its presence in their network.\", \"And finally, we pursue these cases to strip these hackers of anonymity and call them out.  This prevents nation state actors from hiding behind ritualized denials and feigned ignorance.  The recent indictment of Mabna Institute members and the prior indictment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are cases in point.\", \"So that's what's in it for the country.  What's in it for you?  What are the benefits of working with law enforcement -- before, during and after a computer intrusion or attack? \", 'At the end of the day, the Government simply has many more tools at its disposal to deal with the problem of national security cyber intrusions.  Tools that, working together, we can use to respond to intrusions and deter future ones.  Although we will always consider criminal charges, pursuing prosecution may not be the best response in all cases.  Accordingly, NSD attorneys work with their interagency partners to determine whether our investigative information may be used to support sanctions, trade pressure, technical alerts, diplomatic options or other responses instead of, or in addition to, prosecution.  All of these tools can impose real costs on malicious activity, depriving hackers and their sponsors of the benefit of their crimes and deterring future misbehavior.', \"Let me close on this note.  Everyone in this audience understands that we are in this together, and we have an obligation to help one another.  The organization that reports a cyber intrusion doesn't just help itself, it also helps other targeted companies that may not even know they've been victims of a hack, and it helps the country.  It helps other organizations by raising their awareness and sparking a check on their part for similar compromises.  It also enables the government to work to disrupt and deter intrusions of those other organizations. And it helps the country by allowing the Government to piece together and respond to the intentions and actions of antagonistic nations to better defend our nation's economic and military security.\", \"It is the National Security Division's job to disrupt and deter national security cyber threats.  We will continue to work with other agencies to use all elements of national power to meet this ever-changing and growing challenge.  And to adequately protect our shared national cyber security against persistent attack, we will need your help as well.\", 'I look forward to working with you.']\n"

McAllister of the District of Kansas made the announcement.\", 'Weiqiang Zhang, 51, a Chinese national, and U.S. legal permanent resident residing in Manhattan, Kansas, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Carlos Murguia in the District of Kansas. Zhang was convicted on Feb. 15, 2017 of one count of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, one count of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property.', \"Evidence at trial established that Zhang worked as a rice breeder for Ventria Bioscience in Junction City, Kansas.  Ventria develops genetically programmed rice to express recombinant human proteins, which are then extracted for use in the therapeutic and medical fields.  Zhang has a master's degree in agriculture from Shengyang Agricultural University in China and a doctorate from Louisiana State University.\", 'According to trial evidence, Zhang acquired without authorization hundreds of rice seeds produced by Ventria and stored them at his residence in Manhattan.  The rice seeds have a wide variety of health research applications and were developed to produce either human serum albumin, contained in blood, or lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found, for example, in human milk.  Ventria spent millions of dollars and years of research developing its seeds and cost-effective methods to extract the proteins, which are used to develop lifesaving products for global markets. Ventria used locked doors with magnetic card readers to restrict access to the temperature-controlled environment where the seeds were stored and processed.', \"Trial evidence demonstrated that in the summer of 2013, personnel from a crop research institute in China visited Zhang at his home in Manhattan.  Zhang drove the visitors to tour facilities in Iowa, Missouri and Ohio.  On Aug. 7, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers found seeds belonging to Ventria in the luggage of Zhang's visitors as they prepared to leave the United States for China.\", '\"Weiqiang Zhang betrayed his employer by unlawfully providing its proprietary rice seeds to representatives of a Chinese crop institute,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. \"Today\\'s sentence demonstrates the significant consequences awaiting those who would steal trade secrets from American companies.  The Criminal Division and its law enforcement partners will continue to work closely with companies like Ventria to protect American intellectual property--which is essential to our economy and way of life--against all threats both foreign and domestic.\" ', '\"Cross-border intellectual property theft not only hurts victim companies, it also threatens our national security,\" said Assistant Attorney General Demers.  \"FBI\\'s vigilance stopped Ventria\\'s intellectual property from leaving our country in the nick of time, but it was Ventria\\'s cooperation that allowed us to hold Zhang accountable for his crimes.\"', '\"Ventria invested years of research and tens of millions of dollars to create a new and beneficial product,\" said U.S. Attorney McAllister. \"It is vital that we protect such intellectual property from theft and exploitation by foreign interests. We all benefit when American companies continue to drive socially valuable advancements in food, medicine and technology.\"', \"The FBI's Little Rock, Arkansas, Field Office and Kansas City, Missouri, Field Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas investigated the case.

The defendants were each leaders, contractors, associates, hackers-for-hire or affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an Iran-based company that, since at least 2013, conducted a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems belonging to 144 U.S. universities, 176 universities across 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children's Fund.  Through the defendants' activities, the Mabna Institute stole more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from universities, and email accounts of employees at private sector companies, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations.  The defendants conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran's (Iran) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), one of several entities within the government of Iran responsible for gathering intelligence, as well as other Iranian government and university clients.

In furtherance of its mission, the Mabna Institute employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire and other contract personnel to conduct cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual property, email inboxes and other proprietary data, including Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, Mostafa Sadeghi, Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, Mohammed Reza Sabahi, Roozbeh Sabahi, Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, and Sajjad Tahmasebi.  The Mabna Institute contracted with both Iranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on their behalf, and specifically conducted the university spearphishing campaign on behalf of the IRGC.  The Mabna Institute is located at Tehran, Sheikh Bahaii Shomali, Koucheh Dawazdeh Metri Sevom, Plak 14, Vahed 2, Code Posti 1995873351.', 'University Hacking Campaign', 'The Mabna Institute, through the activities of the defendants, targeted more than 100,000 accounts of professors around the world.  They successfully compromised approximately 8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities located in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.  The campaign started in approximately 2013, continued through at least December 2017, and broadly targeted all types of academic data and intellectual property from the systems of compromised universities.  Through the course of the conspiracy, U.S.-based universities spent more than approximately $3.4 billion to procure and access such data and intellectual property.', 'The members of the conspiracy used stolen account credentials to obtain unauthorized access to victim professor accounts, which they used to steal research, and other academic data and documents, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.  The defendants targeted data across all fields of research and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, social sciences, medical, and other professional fields.  The defendants stole at least approximately 31.5 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, which they exfiltrated to servers outside the United States that were under the control of members of the conspiracy.', 'In addition to stealing academic data and login credentials for the benefit of the Government of Iran, the defendants also sold the stolen data through two websites, Megapaper.ir (Megapaper) and Gigapaper.ir (Gigapaper).  Megapaper was operated by Falinoos Company, a company controlled by Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, the defendant, and Gigapaper was affiliated with Karima.  Megapaper sold stolen academic resources to customers within Iran, including Iran-based public universities and institutions, and Gigapaper sold a service to customers within Iran whereby purchasing customers could use compromised university professor accounts to directly access the online library systems of particular U.S.-based and foreign universities.', 'Accompanying Mitigation Efforts', 'Prior to the unsealing of the Indictment, the FBI provided foreign law enforcement partners with detailed information regarding victims within their jurisdictions, so that victims in foreign countries could be notified and foreign partners could assist in remediation efforts.', 'Also, in connection with the unsealing of the Indictment, today the FBI provided private sector partners detailed information regarding the vulnerabilities targeted and the intrusion vectors used by the Mabna Institute in their campaign against private sector companies.

      "['Summary of Outcomes', ' ', 'On October 4, 2017, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke, together with Chinese State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun, co-chaired the first U.S.-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue (LECD).  The LECD is one of four dialogues agreed to by President Trump and President Xi during their first meeting in Mar-a-Lago in April 2017 and is an important forum for advancing bilateral law enforcement and cyber priorities between our two governments. ', 'The following topics were discussed: ', '1) Repatriation. Both sides acknowledged the need to make continued progress in the area of repatriation of foreign nationals with final orders of removal. The United States and China committed to develop a repeatable process whereby the identities of individuals with final orders of removal are verified in a timely manner and travel documents are issued within 30 days of verification. This process should be finalized within three months following the LECD.', ' ', '2) Counter-narcotics.  Both sides intend to continue to enhance cooperation on narcotics control and enforcement. Such cooperation may include: exchanging intelligence and operational information on trafficking of new psychoactive substances and other synthetic drugs, opioids, and cocaine; combatting the illicit production and trafficking of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances and precursor chemicals, with attention to applicable laws, scheduling actions, and use of express mail and consignment services; exchanging technical information on the relevant science and law; demand reduction cooperation; exchanging views on international narcotics control issues through UN-based and other multilateral forums; and sharing tracking information for packages between the two countries so as to identify individuals and criminal networks responsible for narcotics trafficking.  ', ' ', \"3) Cybercrime and Cybersecurity. Both sides will continue their implementation of the consensus reached by the Chinese and American Presidents in 2015 on U.S.-China cybersecurity cooperation, consisting of the five following points: (1) that timely responses should be provided to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber activities; (2) that neither country's government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors; (3) to make common effort to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyberspace within the international community; (4) to maintain a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cybercrime and related issues; and (5) to enhance law enforcement communication on cyber security incidents and to mutually provide timely responses.\", ' ', 'Both sides reiterated that all consensus and cooperative documents achieved at the three rounds of the China-U.S. High-Level Joint Dialogue on Combating Cyber Crimes and Related Issues since 2015 remain valid.', ' ', 'Both sides intend to improve cooperation with each other on cybercrime, including sharing cybercrime-related leads and information, and responding to Mutual Legal Assistance requests, in a timely manner, including with regard to cyber fraud (including business email compromises), hacking crimes, abuse of internet for terrorist purposes, and internet dissemination of child pornography.', ' ', 'Both sides will continue to cooperate on network protection, including maintaining and enhancing cybersecurity information sharing, as well as considering future efforts on cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.', ' ', 'Both sides intend to maintain and make full use of the established hotline mechanism for addressing urgent cybercrime and network protection issues pertaining to significant cybersecurity incidents, and to communicate in a timely way at the leadership level or working level, as needed.', ' ', \"4) Fugitives. Both sides will continue to cooperate to prevent each country from becoming a safe haven for fugitives and will identify viable fugitive cases for cooperation. Both sides plan to continue regular meetings and working groups to identify priority cases. Both sides commit to take actions involving fugitives only on the basis of respect for each other'ssovereignty and laws, and any violation of the above mentioned principles will be addressed in accordance with law. \", ' ', 'While differences remain, both sides intend to make actual progress on all of the above matters, to make possible another Dialogue in 2018 to measure that progress.']\n",

      "['Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. The topics on tap for this summit are precisely the questions that corporate leaders like you must address as we collectively face the ever-evolving threat of malicious cyber activity.', ' ', 'I\\'m here to speak about protecting our national assets from nation-state threats. You may be wondering why I say \"our\" national assets. Certainly there are government secrets that the government must protect. But I\\'m talking about the national assets that are largely in private-sector hands. These assets include our critical infrastructure -- the telecommunications systems, financial systems, electric grids and mass transit systems that sustain our way of life -- as well as the technology, innovations and other crown jewels that drive our economy and help secure our global leadership.', ' ', 'These assets are targets not just for criminals, but also for nation-states and terrorist groups that seek to exploit vulnerabilities in our networks to probe our critical infrastructure, plan destructive attacks, steal our personal information and intellectual property, threaten violence, and extort money much like hostage takers seeking a ransom.  ', ' ', \"Today I'd like to talk to you about the risks to your business from threats to our national security, how the Department of Justice is working to address them, and the ways that you can manage them.  \", ' ', \"As the head of the Department of Justice's National Security Division, my job is to carry out the Department's highest priority -- combatting threats to our national security. I lead more than 350 professionals dedicated to this mission -- whether the threats come in the form of terrorists, spies and weapons proliferators; or national security-related cyber-attacks and other threats against our national assets. Our broad-based approach reflects our philosophy that our national security priorities must include not only the physical safety of all Americans, but also helping you defend against corrupt insiders, hackers and others who would harm your companies and your customers.\", ' ', 'The National Security Division', ' ', 'First, I want to provide some brief background about what our experience with other national security threats, like international terrorism, has taught us about combatting cyber and other threats to our national assets, and how the National Security Division came to be. ', ' ', \"It's no surprise that 9/11 was a watershed moment in our approach to countering terrorism as a government. It both highlighted weaknesses in our government's approach to addressing the terrorist threat and threw into stark relief how significant that threat had become. In particular, it spurred the government to recognize that, if we are to defeat this threat, we must bring to bear the full complement of the federal government's resources. So, while we used military force, we also recognized that law enforcement is a valuable tool for disrupting plots and neutralizing terrorists, and we leveraged economic sanctions and diplomatic measures to attack this global problem.\", ' ', \"Before we could integrate our efforts, we had to bring down the wall that previously existed between the intelligence community and law enforcement -- a wall that stood most firmly in the Department of Justice, where some attorneys prosecuted national security crimes and others interfaced with the intelligence community, always from within separate offices. To end that divide, Congress in 2006 created the Department's first new litigating division in almost half a century, the National Security Division. As a Division, we unite prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the intelligence community to ensure that we approach national security threats using every tool and resource available to the federal government.\", ' ', \"Since the National Security Division's creation, it has become increasingly clear that the factors that motivated our creation and guided our efforts to combat terrorism are equally applicable to our efforts to protect our valuable national assets. In recent years, we have seen more and more attempts by foreign nation-states to acquire sensitive technologies and proprietary information from U.S. companies and to disrupt and destroy critical infrastructure.  \", ' ', 'Economic Espionage', ' ', \"NSD's commitment to protecting national assets has grown in proportion to the threat that we are now facing. As with combatting international terrorism, the federal government has developed a broad-ranging suite of tools to tackle these threats -- including criminal prosecutions, sanctions, trade pressure and diplomatic options -- and, together with our interagency partners, we have the ability to pick the best tool or combination of tools to get the job done under the rule of law.  \", 'For example, we seek to mitigate national security threats posed by foreign nation-state actors by reviewing foreign acquisitions -- which can give the acquiring company access to critical technologies and increase its reach within the U.S. -- and by imposing export controls on U.S. businesses to protect sensitive technologies from reaching the wrong hands. ', ' ', \"But when certain foreign entities eager for sensitive and valuable intellectual property can't acquire it legally and don't want to spend the time or money to develop it on their own, they may take another approach: they may try to steal it. This poses a significant threat to national security -- and a major business risk to the victim company. Economic espionage can take a number of forms. \", ' ', \"Perhaps the most salient form for this audience is theft by cyber intrusion. In May 2014, in a first-of-its kind case, DOJ indicted five Chinese military hackers for stealing trade secrets and sensitive business information from U.S. companies for the benefit of Chinese competitors. The indictment alleged numerous and specific instances in which uniformed officers of the Third Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) hacked into the computer systems of American nuclear power, metals and solar-products companies to steal trade secrets and sensitive internal communications, such as pricing information and trade litigation strategy, that could be used by Chinese companies for commercial advantage. This was the military officers' full-time day job: our indictment alleged that their activity peaked between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m., their time, stopped for an hour -- a healthy lunch break -- and then picked up again from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. No company can expect to always successfully defend against these kinds of organized campaigns.\", ' ', \"In another case from last year, Su Bin, a Chinese businessman, pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy to hack into the computer networks of U.S. defense contractors to steal sensitive information, including data related to military transport aircraft and fighter jets. Su would tell his co-conspirators, military officers in China, what companies to target. When those co-conspirators had successfully gained access, they would send him the directory file listings and folders so that Su could tell them exactly what to steal and why. Su Bin was indicted, found in Canada, transferred to the U.S., and ultimately sentenced to nearly four years in prison for his crimes. But criminal prosecution wasn't the only tool we used. When Su was first arrested, the Commerce Department listed his companies on the Entity List, making it practically impossible for them to obtain goods and services from the United States.\", ' ', 'Cyber intrusions may be the newest form of economic espionage, but they are not the only method of stealing important business secrets. As we have seen over and over again, you should never underestimate insider threats. In 2014, DOJ successfully prosecuted a former DuPont employee and his co-conspirator for stealing trade secrets and selling them to Chinese state-owned companies. The stolen trade secret was the formula for producing the color white (chloride-route titanium dioxide production technology). Its applications are too numerous to list, but needless to say that proprietary process, which took decades to develop and perfect, essentially is priceless to DuPont.', ' ', 'You also can never be too cautious about the physical security of the facilities in which your most sensitive information is stored -- even if it is outside. This past year, a Chinese national, Mo Hailong, was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for stealing inbred corn seeds, the valuable intellectual property of U.S. agricultural products companies, for the benefit of a China-based seed company. As part of its five-year plan, China is openly seeking to develop a self-sustaining food supply through the acquisition of the most cutting-edge agricultural technology. And to show you that IP theft can be a decidedly low tech endeavor, Mo literally stole the corn seeds from the ground: company employees discovered his scheme when he was observed in the fields, on his hands and knees, digging up the seeds.', ' ', 'The Importance of Attribution in Responding to Cyber Attacks', ' ', 'Companies must be ready for all of these varied vulnerabilities, but the threat to your company and our national security is broader than the theft of your intellectual property. We know that state-sponsored actors also exploit vulnerabilities in cyber security for destructive and malicious purposes.', ' ', \"For many years, when acting in cyber space, nation-states and their affiliates enjoyed what they perceived to be a cloak of anonymity -- a cloak they hid behind to break our laws and to threaten our security and economic well-being. They had this perceived cover because they thought we couldn't figure out who did it and, if we did figure it out, we would keep it a secret. But in responding to the cyber threat posed by state-sponsored actors, the government has recognized the importance of attribution -- to name those responsible for online intrusions with confidence, down to the country, government agency, organization or even individuals involved.\", ' ', \"Public attribution alone can have an important deterrent effect. Being publicly identified creates a risk of detention or arrest abroad. It restricts liberty and travel. But perhaps most importantly, hackers, like other thieves, are valued for their ability to get in and get out without getting caught. Anonymity is key for their livelihood and the exposure of public attribution can chill the marketplace for the hacker's services. Public attribution also raises awareness of the threats we face, thereby encouraging resilience and hardened defenses, and it validates victims' sense of violation and loss.\", ' ', \"Moreover, attribution facilitates the use of so many other tools that promote deterrence.  Law enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice are particularly skilled at these kinds of investigations, and, in some cases, attribution leads to public charges and a criminal prosecution. In other cases, prosecution may not be possible, but attribution opens the door for other tools that can change our adversaries' calculus by increasing the costs of their activities. \", ' ', 'In 2015, President Obama issued a new Executive Order specifically aimed at cyber threats. Pursuant to this Executive Order, the Department of the Treasury can sanction individuals or entities who use cyber operations to harm or compromise critical infrastructure or system networks; those who conduct cyber intrusions to steal information for commercial advantage or private financial gain; or those who merely benefit from knowingly receiving such stolen information.', ' ', 'The availability of this tool has proved useful in forging diplomatic solutions to address the threat of cyber theft for commercial gain. Numerous cyber security experts agree that, coupled with the threat of possible U.S. sanctions, our indictment of the Chinese military hackers resulted in a historic agreement in the fall of 2015 by Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders of the G20, that nations should not conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets or confidential business information with the intent to provide commercial advantage to companies or commercial entities. This kind of meeting of the minds of the community of nations drives bilateral negotiations and U.N. Security Council actions.', ' ', 'Disruptive Cyber Attacks', ' ', 'Although cyber security experts have noted an apparent reduction in cyber-enabled economic espionage by China since that agreement -- and it remains to be seen whether that will continue -- if anything, we are witnessing a rise in malicious cyber operations conducted by a variety of nation-states and their affiliates. Most recently, in 2016, President Obama amended the cyber Executive Order to allow the Treasury Department to impose sanctions for tampering with or misappropriating information in order to interfere with or undermine election processes. This was of course in response to Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.  Along with two Russian intelligence services, three Russian companies and four individuals that provided material support to those agencies were sanctioned.', ' ', 'We must remain vigilant against malicious cyber operations aimed at disruption and destruction, which have sowed chaos and imposed substantial costs across a number of economic sectors. In the past few years, we have attributed attacks to state-sponsored actors who seek to harm U.S. companies and infrastructure for their own strategic gain, and we have been able to bring charges against those responsible and enable the use of other tools in order to deter future attacks.', ' ', \"In the Sony Pictures hack in 2014, for example, we saw North Korea wage a destructive cyber attack intended to chill the speech of U.S. citizens and a company in the U.S. The attackers destroyed computer systems, stole valuable information, released corporate data and intellectual property at significant cost, and threatened employees and customers. Based on the FBI's attribution, the U.S. government added new sanctions against North Korea.\", ' ', 'In March 2016, DOJ unsealed an indictment charging seven Iranian hackers for an extensive campaign of distributed denial-of-service attacks against 46 major financial institutions in 2011 and 2012. These attacks cut customers off from online access to their bank accounts and cost the victim companies tens of millions of dollars. These hackers had ties to the Iranian government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.', ' ', \"One of the hackers was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the industrial control systems of the Bowman Dam, located in Rye, New York. Had the dam not been disconnected from the system for maintenance, the intrusion could have given the hacker control of the dam's water levels and flow rates.\", ' ', 'The same week that the Iranian DDOS indictment was unsealed, we unsealed a complaint against members of the Syrian Electronic Army -- a pro-Syrian regime hacker group -- charging them with using spear-phishing and other techniques to collect information used to deface websites, publish pro-Syrian regime propaganda and exfiltrate valuable information. As one of the complaints alleged, the hackers extorted money from victims by threatening further intrusions, defacements and sales of propriety information. In one of these attacks, the Syrian hackers posted a fake news feed on Twitter stating that a bomb had gone off in the White House, injuring the President. In another, the hackers gained access to a recruiting website for the U.S. Marine Corps and posted a defacement encouraging U.S. marines to \"refuse \\'their\\' orders.\"', ' ', \"Just this month, we indicted four individuals responsible for the 2014 hack into Yahoo's network, which involved the theft of information about at least 500 million Yahoo accounts and the use of that information to obtain the contents of accounts at Yahoo and other email providers. Two of the defendants named in the indictment are officers of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), one of the Russian intelligence agencies sanctioned in 2016 by President Obama, who are alleged to have directed their co-conspirators, two criminal hackers, to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere. The FSB unit that the defendants worked for is also the FBI's point of contact in Moscow for cyber-crime matters. The involvement and direction of FSB officers with law enforcement responsibilities makes this conduct that much more egregious.\", ' ', 'Lest you think that we will never be able to bring foreign hackers to justice, our international law enforcement partners have often assisted us in making arrests and extradited those we have indicted for cybercrimes. One of the SEA hackers was arrested at our request in Germany, extradited to the U.S. and pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court. And one of the alleged co-conspirators involved in the Yahoo hack, Karim Baratov, was arrested in Canada on a U.S. provisional arrest warrant; we are seeking to have him brought to the United States to face charges. ', ' ', 'Evolving Threats', ' ', \"These examples show that we will find and expose those who threaten our national assets through cyber-attacks or theft. But those who would do us harm are able to reach further than ever before. I am particularly troubled by efforts to take advantage of companies' vulnerabilities in order to victimize those businesses' customers \", ' ', 'We now see ISIS crowdsourcing terrorism -- using cyber intrusions to obtain information or resources that, when placed in the hands of terrorists, could prove deadly. Ardit Ferizi, the leader of a Kosovar hacking group, hacked into the computer system of a major U.S. retailer, stole the personally identifiable information of thousands of customers, and culled through it to locate the PII of approximately 1,300 American military and government personnel. Ferizi then provided that information to a Syria-based ISIS member, Junaid Hussain, known for calling on aspiring terrorists around the world to commit terrorist attacks at home. Hussain subsequently posted a tweet that linked to a document containing the stolen PII, and threatened:', ' ', 'We are in your emails and computer systems, watching and recording your every move, we have your names and addresses . . . we are passing on your personal information to the soldiers of the khilifah, who soon . . . will strike at your necks in your own lands!', ' ', \"Ferizi was found in Malaysia, transferred to U.S. custody and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to providing material support to ISIS. Hussain was killed in a U.S. military airstrike.\", ' ', 'The Ferizi case also highlights the importance of working with law enforcement even in light of what might appear to the victim company to be an unsophisticated cyber intrusion. Fortunately, the targeted retailer cooperated with law enforcement, which was able to investigate the incident and identify the terrorists behind the keyboards. Even more fortunately, no physical harm came to any Americans as a result of this breach.', ' ', 'Most recently, we\\'ve come to appreciate the vulnerabilities presented by \"smart\" consumer products. While the connectivity of the \"Internet of Things\" provides immense technological opportunity, convenience and efficiency, it also opens up significant vulnerabilities.', ' ', 'Just a few months ago, we saw massive DDOS attacks against the website of a security researcher, a French ISP, and a U.S. DNS registrar, as well as the disruption of internet access for nearly a million users in Germany. All four attacks have been linked to a growing botnet composed of cameras, DVRs, and other devices infected with the Mirai malware. And as we learned, attacks like this one, approaching one terabit per second, can destabilize the core infrastructure of the Internet itself.', ' ', 'Most of those in attendance today probably are familiar, as well, with the vulnerability in auto vehicle control systems exposed by cyber security researchers in 2015, who were able to hack into the system of a sports utility vehicle, gaining the ability to shut down the engine, disable the brakes, affect steering, and control turn signals, door locks, the tachometer, radio, HVAC, and GPS.  This incident resulted in the recall of nearly 1.4 million vehicles.', ' ', \"Given the dynamic intent of our foreign adversaries -- who seek to use cyber operations to cause damage as a foreign policy tool, and not just to access sensitive information -- we are concerned about new national security risks due to the combination of the Internet of Things' vulnerabilities and an increased ability to remotely access systems.\", ' ', 'It is my hope that companies will respond to the threat posed by the Internet of Things in the same vein as social media companies have begun to respond to terrorist use of their platforms. Terrorist groups have leveraged social media tools and mainstream technology to facilitate their operational planning through encrypted communications and to call for sympathizers to conduct their own attacks. After seeing their networks used in ways they neither desired nor even contemplated, social media companies have begun taking steps to reduce the ability to exploit their products. Smart products -- also developed with the best of intentions but without adequate consideration of vulnerabilities -- demand a similar private sector response. Through our outreach efforts, we are trying to raise awareness about the national security threats interconnectivity poses and to encourage IoT developers and manufacturers to prioritize device security early in the design and manufacturing process, rather than after devices have entered into wide commercial use.', ' ', 'Partnering with the Private Sector', ' ', 'So what does this mean for you?  When it comes to threats to our national assets, you are on the front lines. In many cases, your adversaries have the full backing of their foreign governments and so should you. We are here to help.', ' ', 'We work with U.S. companies, across all industry sectors, to ensure that our national security interests are protected. NSD and the FBI stand ready to help you understand:', ' ', ' ', 'We have spent significant time and energy in face-to-face sit-downs so that we may better understand the concerns and challenges facing U.S. companies, share guidance and information, and assist with protection, detection, attribution and response.', ' ', 'We can warn companies that manufacture or sell targeted U.S. technology when certain bad actors are seeking the particular technology they make. We hope to prepare industry for these threats and help you stem the flow of sensitive technology out of the United States.  In the Iowa seeds case, for example, due to the quick action of security staff, the FBI was able to disrupt the threat and hold the perpetrator accountable.', ' ', 'In the case of cross-border transactions, we can share information with you on the types of technology and intellectual property nation-states are targeting to help you assess your vulnerabilities from asset sales, joint ventures and research collaborations.', ' ', \"And in the case of a cyber-attack, if an organization works with law enforcement, it puts both in the best possible position to find out exactly what happened and to remediate and prevent further damage. The evidence is often fleeting, so early notification and access to the data is extremely important. For example, it was Yahoo's valuable cooperation that allowed us to identify the nation-state-affiliated actors responsible for the attack and build our case.\", ' ', 'Law enforcement also may be able to use legal authorities and tools that are unavailable to nongovernmental entities, or enlist the assistance of international partners to locate and take down stolen data or identify a perpetrator.', ' ', \"Early cooperation has many benefits. When we are notified of an intrusion, we share information with other potential victims. In the case of the DDOS attacks on the financial sector, with the cooperation of the private sector, the FBI regularly provided updated information regarding the identity of systems that had been infected with the defendants' malware and were operating as bots within malicious botnets, aiding in the effort to remove the malware to protect customers and other potential victims. One organization's vulnerability is everyone's vulnerability, and it is critical that we work together.\", ' ', \"We recognize that there are a variety of reasons that the private sector may be wary of reporting a possible breach to law enforcement. Concerns about regulators, reputational harm and potential shareholder lawsuits are all legitimate. We are willing to talk through a company's concerns at the outset and work with the company and its counsel to address them. A victim of a cyber-attack is not so different from victims of other crimes, and we seek to treat them that way, respecting their boundaries and concerns.  \", ' ', 'Thank you again for inviting me here today. Our nation is most secure, and our privacy and economic vitality are best protected, when the government and the private sector work together to develop strategies to secure information access, detect threats and respond when incidents do happen.']\n",

Long's employment at UTRC included work on F119 and F135 engines. The F119 engine is employed by the U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft, and the F135 engine is employed by the U.S. Air Force F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.\", 'Beginning in 2013, Long expressed his intent to individuals outside UTRC to return to China to work on research projects at certain state-run universities in China using knowledge and materials he had acquired while employed at the UTRC. To that end, Long interacted with several state-run institutions in China, including the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) and the Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), a state-run university in China affiliated with CAS.', 'During 2013 and 2014, Long was recruited by SIA and other state-run universities, during which he leveraged information that he had obtained while working at UTRC to seek employment in China, culminating in his travel to China in the possession of voluminous documents and data containing highly sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets and export controlled technology, which he had unlawfully stolen from UTRC.', 'In December 2013, after Long agreed in principle to join SIA, an SIA-CAS Director and an SIA-CAS Recruiter asked Long to provide documents from his work at UTRC and examples of projects on which he had worked to substantiate the claims Long made in his application, and interview with SIA. Long agreed.', 'On Dec. 24, 2013, Long emailed several documents to the SIA-CAS Director, including a document that contained the cover page of an export controlled UTRC presentation on Distortion Modeling dated Sept. 30, 2011.', 'While negotiating with SIA, Long also continued to explore other opportunities at other state-run institutions in China. In one email, Long stated: \"I have made my mind to return to China, so have prepared a research plan based on my industry experience and current projects.\" In the research plan, Long stated: \"In the past five years, I have been working with Pratt Whitney, also other UTC business units, like UTAS (including Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich), Sikorsky, CCS (including Carrier and Fire & Security), and Otis. These unique working experiences have provided me a great starting point to perform R&D and further spin off business in China. I believe my efforts will help China to mature its own aircraft engines.\"', 'On May 30, 2014, Long left UTRC. In June 2014, Long traveled to China and began working for SIA. Beginning in July 2014, digital evidence and forensic analysis indicated that Long brought with him and accessed in China a UTRC external hard drive that had been issued to him and that he unlawfully retained.', 'In July 2014, Long was listed as the project leader on a lengthy research plan for CAS involving fourteen other individuals. The plan was replete with references to how the proposed research and development would benefit China. The plan stated: \"The three major engine companies in the world, i.e. GE, Pratt & Whitney in the US and Rolls-Royce in the UK, are all using this technology. . . Our nation lacks the ability to process high performance components, such as airplane wings, tail hooks on carrier aircrafts, and blisks . . . Because of the technology embargo imposed by western developed countries, it is very difficult for us to obtain more advanced design and manufacturing technology . . . This research project will increase our independent ability, efficient and quality in key component manufacturing.\"', 'On or about Aug. 12, 2014, the document on Distortion Modeling - the same document from which Long had sent the cover page to the SIA-CAS Director on Dec. 24, 2013 - was accessed on the external hard drive. Travel records and forensic analysis confirmed that both Long and the external hard drive were in China when this file was accessed.', \"On Aug. 19, 2014, Long returned to the U.S. from China through John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. During a secondary inspection screening by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, Long was found in the possession of a largely completed application for work with a state-controlled aviation and aerospace research center in China. The application highlighted certain parts of Long's work related to the F119 and F135 engines while at UTRC.\", 'On or about Aug. 20, 2014, Long emailed an individual at a university in China, attaching an updated \"achievement and future plan.\" In the plan, Long discussed his work related to the F119 and F135 U.S. military fighter jet engines and stated that he also had knowledge of unpublished UTRC projects in which the U.S. Air Force had shown interest.', \"On Nov. 5, 2014, Long boarded a flight from Ithaca, New York to Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, with a final destination of China. During Long's layover in Newark, CBP officers inspected Long's checked baggage and discovered that it contained sensitive, proprietary and export controlled documents from another defense contractor, Rolls Royce.\", \"Further investigation determined that the U.S. Air Force had convened a consortium of major defense contractors, including Pratt and Rolls Royce, to work together to see whether they could collectively lower the costs of certain metals used. As part of those efforts, members of the consortium shared technical data, subject to restrictions on further dissemination. Rolls Royce reviewed the documents found in Long's possession at Newark Liberty Airport and confirmed that it provided the documents to members of the consortium, which included Pratt. Rolls Royce further confirmed that Long was never an employee of Rolls Royce. A review of UTRC computer records indicated that Long had printed the documents while employed at UTRC. \", \"Long was arrested on a federal criminal complaint on Nov. 7, 2014. A review of Long's digital media seized at the time of his arrest revealed voluminous files protected by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations, and voluminous files proprietary to various U.S. companies. In short, the investigation revealed that Long took his laptop and the UTRC external hard drive with him to China in 2014, at which time there was a substantial body of highly sensitive, proprietary and export controlled materials present on that digital media. UTRC has confirmed that the hard drive that Long unlawfully retained and accessed in China contained not only documents and data from projects on which Long worked while employed at the company but also from projects on which he did not work to which he would have had access. \", 'A sentencing date has not been set.

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Thank you, Sean, for your kind introduction.  And thank you to CSIS for partnering with us in this conference and for your leadership and innovative thinking on critical policy issues that affect us all.  I would like to take a few moments now to reflect on how the National Security Division (NSD) came to be and how, in our first decade, we have strived to achieve our twin aims: protecting the United States against national security threats while safeguarding our core freedoms.', 'The attacks of September 11, 2001, were heartbreaking not only because of the loss of life--the single largest from a foreign attack on American soil in U.S. history--or because they altered our sense of safety in our homes and workplaces, but also because, in the words of the Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, the \"attacks were a shock, but they should not have come as a surprise.\"  The September 11 attacks caught the United States off guard not because we had no information that such an attack by al Qaeda was likely, but because no one put all the information together, made sense of it and shared it with those who could best act on it.', 'In the wake of this tragedy, our growing understanding of the nature of the terrorist threat, both domestically and internationally, led to dramatic changes in the structure of our government.  Among those changes, and based on the recommendations of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, Congress created the National Security Division in 2006--the Department of Justice\\'s first new litigating division in nearly 50 years, since the establishment of the Civil Rights Division in 1957.  As the WMD Commission recognized, bringing together the department\\'s national security-related intelligence, policy, and operational functions into one division would create a \"single focal point on all national security matters\" and would better allow the existing components to \"ac[t] in concert to serve [their] common mission\": combatting terrorism and other threats to national security.  Perhaps more fundamentally, the attacks of September 11 united the nation and the world against a common enemy and with a shared sense of purpose.  At NSD, every day still reflects that powerful sense of unity. ', \"The history of National Security Division's constituent parts in fact starts much earlier than 2006, or even 2001.  The Internal Security Division--now the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES)--was founded as a free-standing division of the Department of Justice in the early years of the Cold War.  Largely focused on investigating and prosecuting suspected Soviet agents, the division's attorneys prosecuted such infamous traitors as the Walker spy ring, Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen.  Its lawyers also pioneered the use of the Classified Information Procedures Act, which allows the United States to prosecute defendants in national security cases fairly while safeguarding classified information. \", \"In 1991, under the leadership of then-Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller, the Criminal Division formed the Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section (TVCS)--now the Counterterrorism Section (CTS)--to serve as a focal point for the department's international and domestic terrorism prosecutions.  During its early years, the section handled a number of hijacking and airplane bombing cases and represented the United States' interests in the Scottish trial arising out of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.  In the ensuing years, TVCS continued to grow in response to new statutory tools enacted in the wake of the First World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.  TVCS also assisted the State Department in the first round of designations of foreign terrorist organizations in 1997, the initial step toward our current regime for prosecuting the crime of providing material support to terrorists.\", 'And finally, the Office of Intelligence and Policy Review (OIPR)--the predecessor to NSD\\'s Office of Intelligence (OI)--was created to implement the intelligence collection regime of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).  FISA was enacted in 1978 in the wake of the Church Committee\\'s revelation that parts of the Intelligence Community had infringed upon the civil liberties of the citizens it was supposed to protect.  The abuses catalogued by the committee were many, including warrantless break-ins, excessive surveillance of politically \"subversive\" groups, and indiscriminate opening of citizens\\' mail.  To address the problems it identified, the Church Committee Report called for oversight of intelligence activity.  In response to this need, FISA provided for oversight by all three branches of government, requiring approval of all FISA warrants by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, searching review by the House and Senate Select Committees on Intelligence and oversight from within the executive branch itself, to be spearheaded by the Attorney General.  While ensuring that intelligence collection pursuant to FISA observed both statutory and constitutional limits, OIPR attorneys obtained intelligence collection authorities that enabled critical FBI counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations.', 'Drawn from these three chains, OIPR, TVCS and ISS coexisted largely independent of one another within the Department of Justice\\'s broader umbrella.  Because of the then-well accepted legal and cultural \"wall\" between intelligence collection under FISA and criminal investigations, interactions between OIPR attorneys and lawyers from the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorneys\\' Offices were limited.  So were contacts between the FBI\\'s law enforcement agents and their intelligence community counterparts.  September 11 forced us to rethink that divide.  With the passage of the USA PATRIOT ACT in 2001 and a 2002 decision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, the legal wall fell, facilitating the later merger of the department\\'s national security-focused entities into one division, following the WMD Commission\\'s critical recommendation.', 'And so, in 2006, the National Security Division was born.  Designed to foster information sharing, coordination and unity of purpose, NSD brings together prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, and the Intelligence Community to respond more effectively to national security threats.  And we continue to honor our historical roots: the Church Committee Report and the 9/11 Commission Report are required reading for all new attorneys in the Division.', \"NSD is comprised of a number of other key offices, beyond CTS, CES, and OI, reflecting its broad mission and the continuing need for greater coordination across government and with our partners abroad: the Foreign Investment Review Staff, drawn originally from both the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and the Office of the Attorney General, supports the department's participation on the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, among other functions.  The Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism works to ensure that American victims of terrorist attacks abroad are supported and given a voice.  And the Office of Law and Policy, among its many hats, participates in the interagency national security policy process, provides legal assistance and advice on matters ranging from legislation to cyber threats to international counterterrorism capacity building, and includes the division's Appellate Unit.\", \"In its first ten years, NSD has demonstrated time and again the wisdom of its founders' vision: that improved coordination and information sharing leads to better results.  Since NSD's creation, the Department of Justice has convicted more than 340 defendants in federal court for terrorism-related charges.  This record of convictions and lengthy sentences we have achieved--and the intelligence we have gained--are testaments to the value of law enforcement in protecting national security.  The division has also seen many notable successes in cases involving espionage, the illegal export of military and strategic goods and services, and cyber attacks related to national security.   \", \"Beyond the numbers, the division's commitment to coordination across the government, internationally, and with the private sector has proven vital.  NSD has adopted an intelligence-led, threat-driven, whole-of-government approach, in which criminal prosecution is a strong and effective tool, but just one of many the U.S. government may bring to bear.  Integrating our policy and intelligence functions with the department's national security prosecutors has allowed us to take advantage of the full array of legal tools, including sanctions, diplomatic engagements and military options, among others, as we combat threats to our national security. \", \"Early in the division's history, to provide one example, attorneys from the Office of Intelligence and the Office of Law and Policy were instrumental in the development and implementation of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which modernized FISA to permit effective and civil liberties-protective foreign intelligence collection in the digital age.  The Office of Intelligence has supported numerous foreign intelligence investigations, as well as criminal prosecutions involving the use of information collected under FISA.  And NSD's counterterrorism prosecutors and attorneys in our Appellate Unit later worked together, along with prosecutors from local U.S. Attorneys' Offices, to successfully implement the protections in the FISA Amendments Act in multiple criminal cases.\", 'In 2009, we successfully prevented a planned attack on the New York City subway by Najibullah Zazi and his co-conspirators.  Externally directed and large scale, this plot resembled the types of terrorist threats we came to expect from al Qaeda and its affiliates.  And in 2010, we obtained convictions from 10 individuals who had served as unlawful agents of the Russian Federation. ', \"But halfway through our first decade, the most pressing threats we faced evolved and expanded and so did we. As we worked to neutralize Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, the threat evolved and expanded to associated groups, like Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Shabaab.  Today, the threat has metastasized to include increasingly diverse and geographically dispersed groups like ISIL and Boko Haram and the homegrown violent extremists ISIL and other terrorist groups inspire in the United States remain unpredictable and hard to detect.  ISIL's use of the Internet to effectively crowdsource terrorism and the shortened flash to bang time between the initiation of a lone-wolf plot and its execution have presented new challenges for the ability to detect and disrupt potential terrorist attacks.  And while much attention has focused on those inspired and directed by al Qaeda and ISIL--and rightly so--we have not lost sight of the domestic terrorism threat posed by other violent extremists motivated by any viewpoint on the full spectrum of hate.  We must do both.\", \"Our work combatting the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters demonstrates the value of NSD's agile, coordinated efforts to meet a global threat.  In the past few years, following the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2178, which calls upon the international community to address the foreign-fighter threat, NSD attorneys have worked with more than 20 countries to develop their criminal legislation and effectively investigate and prosecute foreign fighter cases.  At home, since late 2013, attorneys in the Counterterrorism Section have helped to publicly charge more than 110 individuals in more than 35 districts for foreign fighter, homegrown violent extremism and ISIL-related conduct.\", \"And as computer crimes have been on the rise, we have refocused our efforts to help deter and disrupt cyber-based attacks on our national security.  In 2012, we created the National Security Cyber Specialists (NSCS) Network, a partnership between NSD, the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and U.S. Attorney's Offices across the country, to combat cyber terrorism and state-sponsored computer intrusions.  By linking our components closer together, and looking for opportunities to act, as we did in the unprecedented prosecutions described below, the NSCS Network has been an important part of our whole-of-government effort to deter and disrupt such threats.\", 'In a particularly notable case, in May 2014, NSD, in partnership with the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in Pittsburgh, obtained the first indictment of state-sponsored computer hacking and economic espionage, charging five named members of the Chinese People\\'s Liberation Army based on their theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business information from American companies.  Our actions altered the diplomatic dialogue between the United States and China on this critical issue: A little more than a year later, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly declared, \"China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.\"  The United States and China agreed that neither country\\'s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to their companies or commercial sectors.  And, at the G20 Summit last fall, leaders of the world\\'s most powerful nations pledged not to conduct or support cyber economic espionage.  Now we must work to see that these commitments are honored.', 'Also in 2014, North Korea-sponsored hackers attacked Sony Pictures Entertainment, damaged its computer systems, stole valuable information and private correspondence and released it at significant cost to the company and its employees.  In a matter of mere weeks, through close partnership with Sony and the hard work of the FBI, we publicly named--for the first time--the nation-state responsible for a destructive attack on an American company.  Then, less than two months after the attack, the United States imposed additional sanctions on North Korea. ', 'Likewise, we publicly named--and charged--Iranian hackers affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for their roles in a campaign of distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial sector and members of the Syrian Electronic Army for conspiracies related to computer hacking.  As important as the resolution of these individual cases are, they also promise a larger deterrent for would-be cyber criminals: that we can--and we will--remove the cloak of anonymity.  And that no matter where a hacker is located or who he is affiliated with--whether a nation state or terrorist group--we can figure out who did it, we can do so publicly, and we can impose consequences.', 'Our heightened focus on homegrown violent extremists, foreign fighters and cyber attacks does not mean that we no longer worry about traditional espionage activity or threats from al Qaeda.  Far from it.  Rather, we have continued to meet those more established threats, while remaining vigilant against the new threats that have arisen in our first decade. ', 'In the next decade, the threats will certainly change again.  NSD can and must change with them.   In addition to continuing efforts by terrorists to undermine our way of life, we foresee risks posed by data theft, ransomware and other extortion efforts and the increased vulnerabilities of the so-called \"Internet of Things.\"  What is more, already, we are seeing how cyber attacks can blend and blur with real-world terrorist attacks in unexpected ways.  In August 2015, ISIL-affiliated hackers publicly released the names, locations, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of more than 1,000 U.S. military and other government personnel for the purpose of encouraging terrorist attacks against them.  In a first-of-its-kind case, the Department of Justice charged Ardit Ferizi with a material support violation for providing this stolen information to ISIL.  Ferizi was extradited and ultimately pleaded guilty.  Deterring and disrupting these kinds of threats will require the sorts of interagency, public-private and international cooperation that is at the core of NSD\\'s mission. ', 'As we look ahead to the types of new threats we may face, the importance of engagement with the private sector and with the public cannot be overstated.  As recognized in the 9/11 Commission\\'s Tenth Anniversary Report, \"national security leaders must communicate to the public--in specific terms--what the threat is, how it is evolving, what measures are being taken to address it, [and] why those measures are necessary.\"  We have invested significant energy in engaging with various sectors of the economy and sharing information with the public at large to help people and businesses protect themselves from emerging threats.  In doing so, we achieve our mission and build relationships of trust and common interest.  This will be a critical and ongoing part of our work in the coming years.', \"I cannot fully express my pride in the accomplishments of the men and women of the National Security Division over the past decade.  NSD is a mission-driven team that uses all tools to protect against threats to our national security, while honoring our role in safeguarding our nation's most precious freedoms.  We are committed to working closely with all our partners--from the Intelligence Community to law enforcement, from the private sector here to international partners abroad--to help protect the American people.  We will remain vigilant and ever adaptive as we strive to meet the challenges of the next ten years and beyond.\"]\n"

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Good morning and thank you Dawn [Atlas] for the kind introduction.  I want to recognize the International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition (IACC) and Underwriters Laboratories for organizing this event, for all that you and your members do to protect intellectual property rights and for your long history of collaboration with law enforcement in this area.  I am delighted to be here today with so many industry leaders and representatives from every sector of the intellectual property (IP) community, along with law enforcement officials from across the Americas.  Your voices are a key part of the dialogue as we look for solutions to the growing threat of counterfeiting and other intellectual property crimes.', \"Intellectual property crime endangers the health and safety of our citizens and threatens the very foundation of our economies.  None of us wants a sick loved one taking counterfeits of life-saving pharmaceuticals, such as blood pressure medication, that do not contain the proper active ingredient.  Nobody wants to buy their child a counterfeit toy that is finished with toxic paint.  We don't want to risk the failure of counterfeit integrated circuits in the trucks, airplanes or submarines used by our armed forces.  And yet none of these examples is hypothetical--each was the basis for actual intellectual property cases that the Department of Justice has prosecuted in the past year alone. \", \"This morning, I will focus my remarks on three issues: first, the challenges faced by law enforcement in fighting IP crime; second, the department's strategies to address those challenges; and third, the recent successes we have achieved in our priority enforcement areas.\", 'Challenges in IP Crime Enforcement', 'First, the challenges.  As our supply chain increasingly draws from manufacturers and distributers around the world, the steps we must take to ensure product safety and authenticity are becoming much more complex.  Likewise, as our economies become more global and interdependent, safeguarding the work of innovators and entrepreneurs has never been more important.  At the same time, combatting intellectual property crime has never been more challenging.          ', 'Several recent trends have contributed to this challenge.', 'We must rise to these challenges.  Just as intellectual property crime continues to evolve, so must our strategy to fight it.  We must work together with our partners throughout the U.S. government and in the private sector, and with our law enforcement counterparts around the world.  And that is exactly what we have been doing.  Today, the department has a more comprehensive and effective intellectual property criminal enforcement program than ever before. ', \"The Department's IP Crime Enforcement Program\", \"A key component of our enforcement program is the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section--or CCIPS--in Washington, which is a team of cyber and IP crime experts dedicated to pursuing the largest multi-district and international cases involving cyber and IP crimes.  Leveraging that expertise, the department has also built a network of more than 260 Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property--or CHIP--prosecutors, who are specially trained experts in cyber and IP crime deployed in U.S. Attorneys' Offices across the country.  These specialized prosecutors and forensic experts put us in a position to react quickly to the constant evolution of intellectual property crime and the increasingly sophisticated techniques relied upon by criminals.  Meanwhile, when intellectual property crime becomes a national security concern, as we have seen with the theft of trade secrets by nation-state actors, the department's National Security Division leads our response.        \", \"The FBI also plays a critical role in the department's response to IP crime, and not just through the investigation of individual cases.  The FBI also is engaged in extensive outreach and prevention efforts.  For example, recognizing that third-party online marketplaces and payment processors may unwittingly enable the sale of counterfeit goods, the FBI recently unveiled a strategy to engage these entities to increase awareness and obtain information about criminal activity.\", \"The department also has embraced opportunities to build relationships with government agencies both within and outside our borders.  We work closely with our law enforcement colleagues at the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, which brings together more than 20 U.S. and international partners to address and coordinate the law enforcement response to IP crime.  We also work closely with the Office of the IP Enforcement Coordinator to develop a government-wide approach to IP protection.  In that capacity, we have contributed to the development of the administration's Updated Joint Strategic Plan, which will help chart the direction for IP protection in the U.S. for the next three years.\", \"We rely on our partners at the Department of Homeland Security, and particularly the efforts of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to identify and seize the counterfeits as they cross our borders or are transshipped around the globe.  CBP's ability to detect many of the vast number of counterfeit shipments that arrive every day, whether in cargo containers or direct mail packages, provides leads to other law enforcement agencies and eventually leads to prosecutions of the most serious offenses. \", \"We also have a robust international program and work closely with the State Department to target key countries and regions for capacity building and operational assistance, and to place experienced attorneys as IP Law Enforcement Coordinators to work with our international partners.  I would like to acknowledge Daniel Ackerman, who will be the department's IP Law Enforcement Coordinator--or IPLEC--for Latin America beginning this fall.  Dan will be based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but it is my hope that he will work with each of you to increase our joint capacity to fight IP crime throughout the region. \", 'IPLECs like Dan are at the forefront of our cross-border strategy to root out IP crime around the world.  Indeed, we have successfully leveraged our international partnerships to disrupt the sources of supply in countries on the other side of the planet.  This has resulted in the successful disruption of criminal groups that produced counterfeit pharmaceuticals, dangerous fake airbags, reproductions of electronic equipment--including sub-standard cell phone batteries--and expensive counterfeit luxury goods. ', 'Further, we continue to prioritize outreach to and positive working relationships with a broad cross-section of IP rights holders and very much look forward to hearing your concerns and experiences directly.', \"We also continue to increase our support for and coordination with state and local law enforcement agencies in IP matters.  Since 2009, the department's Office of Justice Programs has awarded more than $22 million in grants to support state and local law enforcement agencies and training and technical assistance providers, and to fund an IP public education campaign.  Of this funding, state and local law enforcement agencies have received almost $17 million in grant funds.  In turn, during the duration of the program, these agencies have seized a total of $345 million in counterfeit merchandise and other property and more than $6 million in currency.  In addition to these seizures, last year, state and local grantees arrested 545 individuals for violation of IP laws; served 175 state and local IP-related search warrants; and disrupted or dismantled 474 piracy and counterfeiting organizations.\", \"The Department's Enforcement Priorities\", 'Of course, at its core, the Department of Justice is responsible for prosecuting federal offenders and a critical piece of our mission is to monitor, evaluate and prioritize areas for enforcement emphasis.  Those priorities include:', 'Some recent examples highlight these focus areas and the creative work of our investigators and prosecutors to stop individual defendants and deter others who might view intellectual property crime as a low-risk, high-profit endeavor.', \"I'll start with the threat posed by counterfeit products to public health and safety.  In recent years, we have seen the counterfeit pharmaceutical trade grow exponentially as criminals aggressively seek to profit from fake painkillers and psychotropic medications.\", 'Earlier this month, a husband and wife in San Francisco were arrested on charges that they operated an illegal pill press to manufacture and distribute counterfeit oxycodone pills, which were laced with fentanyl.  According to the charges, the couple distributed these potentially deadly counterfeit pills through online sales and direct transactions. ', 'Fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance, is a highly potent opiate that can be diluted with cutting agents to create counterfeit pills in an attempt to mimic the effects of oxycodone and is typically used by counterfeiters because it is less costly than genuine oxycodone.  However, even small variations in the amount or quality of fentanyl can have significant effects on the potency of the counterfeit pills, raising the danger of overdoses.  In fact, numerous overdoses and deaths from counterfeit pills containing fentanyl have been reported, including 14 in the state of California this year alone.  The critical health risks posed by this form of counterfeiting require an aggressive response from law enforcement at all levels--including through joint efforts between federal and local authorities, as in this case--and we will continue to develop our ability to combat these illegal, dangerous schemes.', \"In addition, the department continues to be vigilant in safeguarding U.S. businesses' trade secrets despite the growing sophistication and ambition of would-be thieves. \", \"This month an electrical engineer in California was sentenced to federal prison following his conviction on 32 counts of violating the Economic Espionage Act for stealing trade secrets belonging to his former employer--an aircraft avionics company--and distributing the proprietary material to three competitors.  During his brief employment with the victim company, the defendant had access to corporate trade secrets.  After he was terminated, he retained trade secret information that he had collected and packaged it with supporting documentation and instructions so that other competitor companies would be able to use the information and reproduce the victim company's products. \", 'Using email addresses created under a false name and a public internet connection at a popular coffee shop, the defendant sent the stolen trade secrets to other companies that produced avionics, including a company outside of the United States.  Fortunately, one of the companies that received the stolen plans stepped forward to notify the FBI, which was able to successfully identify the defendant and locate the evidence which led to his conviction.  This case illustrates the importance of maintaining strong relationships between the private sector and law enforcement in the IP space.', 'Further, we have worked to dismantle online piracy sites used by criminals to distribute infringing products, sometimes on a massive scale and with international reach.  Technology has truly been a game-changer for IP crime in this area but law enforcement is working to keep pace.', \"In December 2015, the owner of Seattle-based companies Digisoft LLC and Premiere Software Inc. pleaded guilty for his role in a widespread, multimillion-dollar conspiracy involving trademark and copyright infringement of Microsoft and other software company products.  Co-conspirators operating in the People's Republic of China, Singapore, Germany and across the United States illegally sold 170,000 Microsoft and Adobe Systems product activation key codes through a charitable organization and several online businesses.  To date, six defendants have pleaded guilty and investigators have seized more than $20.6 million in assets, 10 luxury automobiles and 27 parcels of real estate with a total market valuation of $9.7 million.  It is estimated that the conspirators reaped about $30 million in profits from customers who paid more than $100 million for the software and these estimates are likely to grow as the investigation continues.\", 'Finally, it has long been our experience that, where there is a profit to be made from illegal activity, organized criminal groups will not be far behind.  We are looking at new ways to work with other law enforcement components to remove the profit motive by disrupting payments, increasing criminal enforcement and making the cost of doing business too high to be worthwhile, and by reducing the number of international safe harbor countries that do not effectively address IP crime committed within their borders.', 'Our strategy is paying dividends with a growing number of high-impact prosecutions and higher sentences, and--by our public messaging--an increased deterrent effect on other IP criminals.  However, any true success in this task can only result from our work in partnership with the industry leaders and law enforcement experts in this room.  I want to applaud, for example, the innovative and cooperative work of the IACC and the Office of the IP Enforcement Coordinator in leading the way with the Rogue Block program and other voluntary agreements with payment processors and large online markets to reduce piracy and counterfeiting by helping to identify and remove the worst violators from their platforms.  By increasing the degree of difficulty for counterfeiters seeking to receive payment for their fake goods, you have created a powerful disincentive to their business model.  Your insight and creativity, the same attributes that have helped to build and sustain successful businesses, have provided invaluable leadership in seeking new methods to protect IP.', \"Let's continue that spirit of creativity and cooperation to help strengthen our joint work to detect, report and combat IP crimes.  Expand your efforts to educate the public about the prevalence and the consequences of these offenses.  Strengthen your own ability to prevent IP crimes that affect people, companies, products and services.  And help us enhance our understanding of emerging trends in counterfeiting, piracy and trade secret theft, so we can develop the tools we need to fight back. \", 'I thank you for your time and hope that this conference has been informative and productive and will provide a foundation for future success in fighting IP crimes.

      "[\"Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged in a six-count superseding indictment with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, in connection with Xu's theft of proprietary source code from his former employer, with the intent to benefit the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China.\", 'The superseding indictment was announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.', 'Xu was initially arrested by the FBI on Dec. 7, 2015, and was previously charged with one count of theft of trade secrets.  Xu is scheduled to be arraigned on the superseding indictment at 12 p.m. EDT on June 16, 2016, before U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Karas of the Southern District of New York.', '\"Xu allegedly stole proprietary information from his former employer for his own profit and the benefit of the Chinese government,\" said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.  \"Those who steal America\\'s trade secrets for the benefit of foreign nations pose a threat to our economic and national security interests.  The National Security Division will continue to work tirelessly to identify, pursue and prosecute any individual who attempts to harm American businesses by robbing them of their valuable intellectual property.\"', '\"As alleged, Xu Jiaqiang is charged with stealing valuable, proprietary software from his former employer, an American company, that he intended to share with an agency within the Chinese government,\" said U.S. Attorney Bharara.  \"Economic espionage not only harms victim companies that have years or even decades of work stolen, but it also crushes the spirit of innovation and fair play in the global economy.  Economic espionage is a serious federal crime, for which my office, the Department of Justice\\'s National Security Division, and the FBI will show no tolerance.\"', 'According to the allegations contained in the criminal complaint on which Xu was initially arrested, the original indictment and the superseding indictment:', \"From November 2010 to May 2014, Xu worked as a developer for a particular U.S. company (victim company).  As a developer, Xu had access to certain proprietary software, as well as that software's underlying source code.  The proprietary software is a clustered file system developed and marketed by the victim company in the United States and other countries.  A clustered file system facilitates faster computer performance by coordinating work among multiple servers.  The victim company takes significant precautions to protect the proprietary source code as a trade secret because the value of the proprietary source code depends in part on its secrecy.  Among other things, the proprietary source code is stored behind a company firewall and can be accessed by only a small subset of the victim company's employees.  Before receiving proprietary source code access, victim company employees must first request and receive approval from a particular victim company official.  Victim company employees must also agree in writing at both the outset and the conclusion of their employment that they will maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information.     \", \"In May 2014, Xu voluntarily resigned from the victim company.  Xu subsequently communicated with one undercover law enforcement officer (UC-1), who posed as a financial investor aiming to start a large-data storage technology company, and another undercover law enforcement officer (UC-2), who posed as a project manager working for UC-1.  In these communications, Xu discussed his past work with the victim company and indicated that he had experience with the proprietary software and the proprietary source code.  On March 6, 2015, Xu sent UC-1 and UC-2 a code, which Xu stated was a sample of Xu's prior work with the victim company.  A victim company employee (employee-1) later confirmed that the code sent by Xu included proprietary victim company material that related to the proprietary source code. \", \"Xu subsequently informed UC-2 that he was willing to consider providing UC-2's company with the proprietary source code as a platform for UC-2's company to facilitate the development of UC-2's company's own data storage system.  Xu informed UC-2 that if UC-2 set up several computers as a small network, then Xu would remotely install the proprietary software so that UC-1 and UC-2 could test it and confirm its functionality.\", \"In or around early August 2015, the FBI arranged for a computer network to be set up, consistent with Xu's specifications (UC network).  Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network.  Thereafter, on or about Aug. 26, 2015, Xu and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the upload.  In September 2015, the FBI made Xu's upload available to a victim company employee who has expertise regarding the proprietary software and the proprietary source code (employee-2).  Based on employee-2's analysis of technical features of Xu's upload, it appeared to employee-2 that the upload contained a functioning copy of the proprietary software.  It further appeared to employee-2 that Xu's upload had been built by someone with access to the proprietary source code that was not working within the victim company or otherwise at the victim company's direction.\", \"On Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York.  Xu stated, in sum and substance, that he had used the proprietary source code to make software to sell to customers, that he knew the proprietary source code was the product of decades of work on the part of the victim company and that he had used the proprietary source code to build a copy of the proprietary software, which he had uploaded and installed on the UC network.  Xu also indicated that he knew that the copy of the proprietary software he had installed on the UC network contained information identifying the proprietary software as the victim company's property, which could reveal the fact that the proprietary software had been built with the proprietary source code without the victim company's authorization.  Xu told UC-2 that he could take steps to prevent detection of the proprietary software's origins, including writing computer scripts that would modify the proprietary source code to conceal its origins.\", \"Later on Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the hotel.  During that meeting, Xu showed UC-2 a copy of what he represented to be the proprietary source code on his laptop.  Xu noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the victim company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted.  Xu also stated that he had previously modified the proprietary source code's command interface to conceal the fact that the proprietary source code originated with the victim company and identified multiple specific customers to whom he had previously provided the proprietary software using his stolen copy of the proprietary source code.\", \"In connection with the economic espionage counts charged in the superseding indictment, Xu stole, duplicated and possessed the proprietary source code with the intent to benefit the National Health and Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China.\", 'The superseding indictment charges Xu with three counts of economic espionage, which each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.  He was also charged with three counts of theft of a trade secret, which each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.', 'A superseding indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.  Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty.', \"The case is being investigated by the FBI, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee and Ilan Graff of the Southern District of New York, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\", 'Xu Superseding Indictment']\n",

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Thank you for that introduction, [U.S. Attorney] Kevin [Techau].', \"And thank you for inviting me to speak today about the national security threats facing our nation.  This event comes on the heels of a landmark week for the department's national security cyber program, and I want to start by saying a few words about our strategy and recent successes in this space.\", \"For many years, nation states and their affiliates enjoyed what they perceived to be a cloak of anonymity when acting in cyber space.  A cloak they hid behind to break our laws through cyber intrusions and to threaten our security and economic well-being.  They had this perceived cloak because they thought we couldn't figure out who did it and, if we did figure it out, we would keep it a secret.\", 'Last week, we proved yet again - through a number of law enforcement actions - that we will find and expose those who threaten our national security through cyber attacks or theft. ', 'First and foremost, we unsealed an indictment charging seven experienced Iranian computer hackers for their roles in an extensive campaign of distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial sector.', 'The damage was real: 46 major financial institutions attacked over 176 days, hit by as much as 140 Gigabits of data per second, costing the victims tens of millions of dollars.', \"In addition, one defendant is also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam, located in Rye, New York.  The intrusion could have given the hacker control of the dam's water levels and flow rates if it had not been disconnected from the system for maintenance.\", 'These attacks threatened public health and safety, and our economy.  And this indictment exposes the faces and names behind the keyboards in Iran used to orchestrate these attacks against us - the attackers were employed by two computer security companies that work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.', 'That same week, we unsealed a complaint against members of the Syrian Electronic Army, for activity that sought to harm the economic and national security of the United States in the name of Syria and sought to extort law-abiding people all over the world to line their own pockets.', 'And, following his waiver of extradition from Canada, a Chinese businessman in Los Angeles entered a guilty plea for his role in a conspiracy to hack into the computer networks of U.S. defense contractors, including Boeing, and stealing sensitive information, including data related to military transport aircraft and fighter jets.', \"Last week's announcements prove, once again, there is no free pass for nation state affiliated computer intrusions. \", 'The Role of the National Security Division', 'Disrupting these national security threats is among the highest priorities of the Department of Justice and the National Security Division.  Let me share a bit of background on the National Security Division, and what our experience combatting the threat of terrorism has taught us about combating other national security threats, including threats to our national assets.', \"The September 11th terrorist attacks showed us that putting walls up between foreign intelligence and law enforcement makes connecting the dots of a plot very difficult.  So a decade ago, Congress created the department's first new litigating division in almost half a century, the National Security Division.\", \"We ensure unity of purpose in the department's number-one mission - to protect against terrorism and other threats to our national security.  And we unite prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the intelligence community, to ensure that we approach national security threats using every tool and resource available to the federal government.\", \"In the years since National Security Division's creation, it is increasingly clear that the factors that motivated our creation and guided our efforts to combat terrorism are equally true in our efforts to protect our valuable national assets.\", 'As with counterterrorism, we realized that prosecution is only one of the many tools the U.S. government brings to bear.  So the National Security Division restructured and adapted to support a whole-of-government approach to national security cyber threats.  Criminal prosecutions, sanctions, trade pressure and diplomatic options are just some of the responses available to us as we combat online threats to the national security.', \"Underlying all of the government's policy options is the need for attribution - to attribute online intrusions with confidence, down to the country, government agency, organization or even individuals involved.\", 'Law enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice are uniquely well suited for these kinds of investigations.  And these investigations are the bedrock of our whole-of-government approach because they facilitate the use of so many other tools that promote deterrence.', 'In some cases, attribution leads to public charges and a criminal prosecution.  In other cases, a prosecution may not be the right option, but attribution opens the door for sanctions, disruption operations and bilateral diplomacy.', 'Our attorneys live by that whole-of-government approach.  We work with our government partners to pick the best tool or combination of tools to get the job done under the rule of law.', 'We ensure that we have the necessary expertise no matter who is behind the threat, what their motivation is or what tool we need to use.', \"Under unified NSD leadership, we have integrated the department's full range of national security expertise under one roof, bringing varied skills and knowledge to the full range of national security challenges.\", 'The Threats to our National Assets', 'The threat landscape we face is ever-changing and evolving, and while our top priority remains combating terrorism, we have also sharpened our focus and increased our attention on the emerging threats to our national assets, including the threat of economic espionage.', \"And we have seen that these threats are not confined to banks in New York or defense contractors in California.  Our entire nation, including America's heartland here in Iowa, is under constant attack from foreign adversaries and competitors who try to steal trade secrets and other intellectual property, at the expense of our economy and national security.\", \"When certain foreign entities eager for sensitive and valuable information can't buy it, they may take another approach: they try to steal it.  Corporate theft can occur through insiders employed by a company - or it can occur remotely, through cyber intrusions that exploit a vulnerability present in a company's networks.  Companies must be ready for all of these vectors of vulnerability.\", \"Iowa is a fitting place to address these topics.  Iowa's agricultural and food production, renewable energy, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing are an integral part of the country's economic engine.  Between 2002 and 2011, Iowa's agricultural production grew over 200 percent.  This growth is attributable in part to the tremendous innovation that is taking place in the American agriculture sector.  According to one government study, agricultural biotech accounts for $80 billion of a $260 billion biotechnology sector.\", 'You are revolutionizing the way America grows crops.  You invest in biotechnology research to develop higher-yielding, drought-resistant crops.  You rely on data from sophisticated soil sensors, satellites and drones to optimize the use of water and pesticides.', \"But, while you spend your days innovating, others spend their days on campaigns to steal the fruits of Americans' labor. \", 'Just this year, here in Iowa, Mo Hailong, a lawful permanent resident and employee of a China-based seed company, was convicted of participating in a long-term conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, for the purpose of covertly transferring the technology to China.', 'Hailong and his co-conspirators brazenly stole inbred corn seeds from production fields not far from here.  Although he knew that this technology was the valuable and confidential intellectual property of DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, he stole it for the benefit of his China-based company.', 'The threat of this kind of economic espionage is serious.  Some estimate that, every year, the U.S. loses more than $300 billion from theft of our intellectual property.  That figure is about equivalent to the current annual level of U.S. exports to Asia.  Losses of that magnitude cost the American economy untold numbers of jobs.', 'They reduce the profit that American firms make from research and development, which in turn reduces the incentives and resources for innovation.  And the activity undermines the trust between countries and companies that is necessary to do business in a globalized economy.', 'As companies move to digital storage, economic espionage increasingly occurs not just through insider threats but also through cyber activity.  As a result of the proliferation of technology - and the myriad ways to exploit it - we face a changing world order in which lone hackers, organized crime syndicates and nation states are all increasingly able to harm our shared networks and our livelihood.  Every sector of the economy is a target - agriculture, energy, financial institutions, infrastructure, entertainment and more.', 'And hackers come in all shapes and sizes.  We have seen state and non-state actors using the Internet to steal our intellectual property and export-controlled information at unprecedented levels.', \"For example, in May 2014, after a lengthy investigation, the department indicted five Chinese military officers by name for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at American companies.  The indictment describes numerous and specific instances where uniformed officers of the People's Liberation Army hacked into the computer systems of American nuclear power, metals and solar-products companies to steal trade secrets and sensitive, internal communications that could be used by Chinese companies to give them a commercial leg-up.\", 'The investigation, and the public charges it led to, have had a lasting impact.  At the time, our indictment was met with indignant denials.  But a year later, after rumors circulated that additional costs might be imposed, Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly declared, during his state visit in September, that, \"China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.\"  The United States and China committed that neither country\\'s government will conduct, or knowingly support, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets or confidential business information with the intent of providing competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors.', \"And, at the G20 Summit last fall, leaders of the world's most powerful nations pledged not to conduct or support cyber economic espionage.  What began with denials ended, at least for now, with a shift in international norms and a commitment from China to change its behavior. \", \"Of course, indictments of state-sponsored hackers will not, on their own, prevent all cyber theft.  This is the very point of an all-tools, whole-of-government approach.  We need to exert pressure on bad actors from every possible angle.  Prosecutions are just one tool in the broader Justice Department approach, which is just one angle from which the U.S. can pressure nation-state actors.  The ultimate success of this approach will depend on the ability of U.S. agencies and departments to strengthen and support one another's actions.\", 'We will not stand idly by as others attempt to steal from us.  We will hold them accountable - no matter who they are, where they are or the means by which they steal.', 'Public-Private Partnership', 'But we cannot do it alone.  Your companies - and thus, you, have a critical role to play.', 'In the case of Hailong, the investigation was initiated when DuPont Pioneer security staff detected suspicious activity and alerted the FBI.  DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto cooperated fully throughout the investigation, and that cooperation was essential to disrupt the theft of American technology and hold the perpetrator accountable.', \"As leaders in your industries, you are on the front lines defending your companies' valuable intellectual property against insider threats, cyber-attacks and other bad actors determined to erode America's status as a global leader in those fields.\", 'We know from experience that those seeking to do us harm will look for any available vulnerability to exploit.  In many cases, your adversaries have the full backing of their foreign governments and so should you.', \"As a nation, we must work together to deter and disrupt these threats, and to change our adversaries' calculus by increasing their cost.  Our strategy must ensure there is no free pass.\", \"But the government's response is only one half of the equation.  We need your help.  Our nation's crown jewels are overwhelmingly in private sector hands.  And so we work with U.S. companies, across all industry sectors, to ensure that our national security interests are protected. \", 'We have spent time and energy in face-to-face sit downs so that we may better understand the concerns and challenges facing U.S. companies, share guidance and information, and assist with protection, detection, attribution and response.  We can warn companies that manufacture or sell targeted U.S. technology when certain bad actors are seeking the particular technology they make.', 'Corporate outreach sensitizes industry to the threat they face and helps to stem the flow of sensitive technology out of the United States.', 'This type of cooperation is especially important with respect to cyber-enabled threats.  After all, the Internet runs on private infrastructure and the hardware and software that we all use - including in the government - is developed and maintained by the private sector.', 'After an attack, if an organization works with law enforcement, it puts both in the best possible position to find out exactly what happened and to remediate and prevent further damage.  The evidence is often fleeting, so early notification and access to the data is extremely important.', \"In addition, we may have seen the same indicators of malicious activity in other attacks, so we can conclude who was responsible and identify possible impacts and means of remediation.  Importantly, it also allows us to share information with other potential victims.  One organization's vulnerability is everyone's vulnerability and it is critical that we work together.\", 'Law enforcement may be able to use legal authorities and tools that are unavailable to non-governmental entities.  Law enforcement can also enlist the assistance of international partners to locate stolen data or identify a perpetrator.', 'These tools and relationships can greatly increase the odds of successfully apprehending an intruder or attacker and securing lost data.  Finally, this cooperation is vital to successful prosecutions that, as I explained, can prevent criminals from causing further damage to victim companies and others.', 'A united front is critical because the threat you face includes hackers with the full backing of their governments or that are part of sophisticated, international criminal syndicates.  They have backup, but so do you - because your government is here to help.', 'Last year, we announced a new position within the National Security Division focused on outreach to the private sector.  This position was created in recognition of the importance of relationships and cooperation in cybersecurity.  We understand the importance of prevention and of resilience.  We want to support our private sector partners, whether they simply want to establish early lines of communication or call while under the strain of a continuing network breach.', 'The conversations we have at these events are essential to keep our nation secure, to protect the privacy of our citizens, to enable American businesses to compete fairly in our global economy and to ensure that U.S. businesses and institutions are resilient in the face of cyber threats.  While we gather here in Iowa to work together to make this country safer, our adversaries likewise gather to strategize against us.  The threats are not letting up and neither will we.', 'Thanks again for inviting me.  I look forward to your questions.']\n"

The conspirators distributed more than 170,000 product activation key codes and many of these key codes were each used and activated numerous times.\", 'Investigators seized more than $20.6 million in assets, including $10,188,777 seized from bank and investment accounts, 10 luxury automobiles and 27 parcels of real estate with a total market valuation of $9,739,399, through federal forfeitures.  Affidavits filed in those forfeiture complaints estimate that conspirators reaped about $30 million in profits from customers who paid more than $100 million for the software.', 'Search warrants have been executed at 13 separate residential and business locations in five different states in the course of this investigation.', 'Kansas City: USA v. Ross', 'Casey Lee Ross, 29, of Kansas City, pleaded guilty on June 11, 2015, to his role in the conspiracy.  The investigation began in 2013, when federal agents in Kansas City learned that Ross, the owner of Software Slashers, had purchased and redistributed tens of thousands of illegitimate and unauthorized Microsoft product key codes and counterfeit product key cards from sources in China.', 'Ross admitted that he purchased approximately 30,159 product key codes and counterfeit product key cards.  Ross purchased these product key codes at prices well below that of the estimated retail price.  In many cases, they were distributed on counterfeit card stock intended to make it appear as if they were genuine Microsoft products.', 'Ross distributed large quantities of these product key codes and counterfeit Microsoft product key cards to co-conspirators in the United States, who in turn sold the product key codes and counterfeit product key cards through their respective websites, as well as on e-commerce sites such as eBay or Amazon.

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Thank you for that introduction, Jack [Goldsmith].', 'And thank you to Dean Minow, Julissa Milligan and the Harvard National Security Journal, and the entire Harvard Law School (HLS) Community for inviting me to speak.  As a graduate of HLS, it is good to see that, thanks to wonderful changes made since I graduated, HLS has encouraged the best-trained lawyers in the country to pursue public service.', \"I am also grateful for the Heyman Fellowship Program, which supports HLS alumni at the beginning of their careers in service to the federal government.  As a member of the inaugural class of Heyman Fellows, I began my legal career at the Department of Justice, through the department's Honors Program, and have been able to spend the entirety of my legal career as a public servant.\", \"As an alumnus, it is exciting to see how HLS remains at the forefront of cutting-edge legal issues.  As the world around us changes, HLS has staked its place as a thought leader.  HLS has taken a prominent role in the fields of national security and cybersecurity.  From the Berkman Center for Internet and Society and the Harvard National Security Journal, to leading academics like Jack and Phil Heymann, HLS's place in the national security cyber policy discussion is inarguable.\", 'Today\\'s conversation is an urgent one.  In 2012, Leon Panetta described the nation\\'s lack of cybersecurity as a \"pre-9/11 moment.\"  Nation states and terrorist groups are probing our critical infrastructure, planning destructive attacks and stealing our personal information and intellectual property.', 'The Role of the National Security Division', \"As a nation, we must have a strategy to deter and disrupt this high-stakes hacking, to change our adversaries' calculus by increasing its cost.  Simply being shielded (if not sponsored) by a foreign power will not offer protection.  Our strategy must ensure there is no free pass.\", 'Let me start today with a bit of background about what our experience with other national security threats, like terrorism, can teach us about combating the cyber threat, and why the Department of Justice created the National Security Division.', 'Our approach to countering terrorism as a government shifted after 9/11, in recognition of the fact that we needed to approach the problem using every tool and resource available to the federal government.  So, obviously, we used military force, but we also recognized that law enforcement is a valuable tool for disrupting plots and neutralizing terrorists, and that financial sanctions and diplomatic pressure play key roles as well.  We created military commissions to address the unique challenges of foreign captures and classified information, but we also relied on our time-tested U.S. district courts to do what they have done for centuries: provide fair trials and meaningful punishments for serious federal crimes.', \"And we, as a department, rotated to better integrate the work of prosecutors and law enforcement officials with the Intelligence Community.  The 9/11 Commission Report recognized that the lack of information-sharing prior to 9/11 left the U.S. vulnerable to terrorist attack.  So nearly a decade ago, Congress created the department's first new litigating division in almost half a century, the National Security Division (or NSD for short).  We ensure unity of purpose in the department's number-one mission - to protect against terrorism and all threats to our national security. \", \"As a result of our creation, federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents across the country immerse themselves in intelligence information, in part so that they can build more, and better, criminal cases and thereby protect the homeland.  Not every tool fits every case - certainly, we will only arrest and prosecute a fraction of the terrorists we fight.  But in the years since NSD's creation, it is increasingly clear that the factors that motivated our creation and guided our efforts to combat terrorism are equally true in the cybersecurity realm.  That is why we apply the lessons we learned in the counterterrorism context to national security cyber threats.  Together with our interagency partners, the federal government has developed a suite of tools available to us to combat online threats to national security - including criminal prosecution, sanctions and designations and diplomacy - and we have the ability to pick the best tool or combination of tools to get the job done under the rule of law.\", 'Our attorneys, as well as our national security partners in the FBI and elsewhere in the government, live by the all-tools approach.  We ensure that we have the necessary expertise no matter who is behind the threat, what their motivation is or what tool we need to use.', 'The Threats We Face', 'That integration is critical as we face a wave of new cyber threats and intrusions that raise national security concerns.', 'In the Sony hack, just over a year ago, we saw a foreign, state-sponsored actor wage a destructive cyber attack intended to chill the speech of U.S. citizens and a company in the United States.  The attack was perpetrated by North Korean-sponsored hackers who destroyed computer systems, stole valuable information, released corporate data and intellectual property at significant cost and threatened employees and customers.', 'Destroying data and networks is serious.  But the threats go well beyond that.  Cyber intrusions can inflict significant physical damage.  Last year, the Department of Homeland Security warned about infections targeting industrial control systems, with malware like \"Black Energy.\"  Shortly thereafter, Germany\\'s Federal Office for Information Security released a report describing a cyber attack on a steel mill that reportedly caused \"massive damage.\"  That attack began, as so many intrusions do, with a spearphishing e-mail.  The hackers moved from the company\\'s business network to the plant\\'s production network, which controlled the plant\\'s equipment, then caused cascading failures across systems that, ultimately, prevented the plant from shutting down its blast furnace.', \"Well known to all of us, intrusions also target the personal information of tens of millions of Americans.  Perhaps most notably, the OPM intrusion resulted in the compromise of millions of sensitive records, including background-investigation files for federal employees who hold security clearances.  Similar intrusions over the past two years have targeted major health insurers' customer financial and medical information, and even airline passenger travel reservation records.  Recently, a New York Blue Cross Blue Shield provider revealed that it was the victim of a massive breach, exposing the data of more than 10 million people. \", 'In short, online threats of all types are increasing in frequency, sophistication and scope. And these threats are occurring against a background of increasing worry about the nation\\'s overall network security.  The past year has seen the announcement of several significant software vulnerabilities - some now so famous that they have their own dramatic brand names: Heartbleed, Shellshock and Stagefright.  This year, the Department of Homeland Security\\'s Computer Emergency Readiness Team published a list of 30 \"high risk vulnerabilities\" that they say are exploited in as many as 85 percent of attacks on critical infrastructure organizations.  These included several software vulnerabilities that were disclosed years ago, including one as far back as 2006.  This means that companies are not only falling victim to new and unidentified exploits, but also to vulnerabilities that have been known for almost a decade.', \"And at the same time, new threats appear on the horizon.  Terrorists seek to exploit our reliance on weak or outdated network security to harm our way of life.  To date, terrorist groups are largely only experimenting with destructive hacking, but they are developing more advanced capabilities.  We've also seen calls to action through Internet jihad by both Al Qaeda and ISIL, and our international partners have experienced attacks conducted by purported online jihadists.  We are concerned that those groups will not hesitate to deploy offensive capabilities if they are able to acquire them.\", \"We are already seeing online threats converge with terrorism.  Just last month, we charged a defendant with soliciting the murder of military members after he disseminated ISIL's violent rhetoric online calling for the killing of American service members in the United States.  According to the criminal charges, the defendant circulated detailed information about U.S. military personnel to urge recipients to murder the service members in their homes and communities.  These charges follow a complaint we unsealed in October against a hacker who stole PII of over 1,000 U.S. government personnel from a U.S. business and provided it to ISIL, so that it could be used by ISIL against those individuals.\", 'Our Response: Public Attribution and the Tools It Enables', \"It's clear that the threats are growing, and both the government and the private sector need to improve their defensive capabilities.  But improving cybersecurity practices and building more resilient systems will not be enough.  Because the attacker always has the advantage.  The defender must protect against all vulnerabilities at all times.  The attacker only has to succeed in one place at one time.\", \"Thus, to make real progress, we must not only defend against and disrupt attacks, but also deter them in the first place.  In other words, we must fundamentally change our adversaries' cost-benefit analysis.\", 'But to deter our adversaries, we must know who they are and what makes them tick.  We must be able to attribute their actions with confidence - down to the country, government agency, organization or even individuals involved.', 'And that is no easy feat.  Anonymous accounts, third-party proxies, rented and compromised servers and the international nature of our investigations make our jobs tough.  But through a mix of formal authority, cyber expertise and cooperative relationships with private-sector victims and international partners, we can track down cyber attackers and ensure their crimes are not without significant cost.', 'Law enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice are uniquely good at these kinds of investigations.  And they are the bedrock of our approach because they facilitate the use of so many other tools that promote deterrence.  And we have already seen results.', 'For example, in May 2014, after a lengthy investigation, the department indicted five Chinese military officers by name for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at American companies.  The 48-page indictment describes numerous and specific instances where uniformed officers of the PLA hacked into the computer systems of American nuclear power, metals and solar-products companies to steal trade secrets and sensitive, internal communications that could be used by Chinese companies to give them a commercial leg-up.', 'But the investigation, and the public charges it led to, have had a lasting impact.  Last spring, our indictment was met with indignant denials.  But a year later (and after rumors circulated that additional costs might be imposed), Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly declared, during his state visit in September, that, \"China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.\"  The United States and China committed that neither country\\'s government will conduct, or knowingly support, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets or confidential business information with the intent of providing competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors.  And, at the G20 Summit last month, leaders of the world\\'s most powerful nations pledged not to conduct or support cyber economic espionage.  What began with denials ended, at least for now, with a shift in international norms and a commitment from China to change its behavior.  We must hold them to that accord.', 'Of course, prosecution will not always be the only option, or even the right one.  We may not be able to gain custody over the defendant, or the case may involve classified information that cannot be disclosed in open court.  So, you might ask, why investigate targets that we might never apprehend?', 'The answer is three-fold: one, public attribution itself can have a deterrent effect; two, public attribution charges can also have a positive effect on victims of cyber crime; and three, investigation and attribution enables the use of other tools, including sanctions and diplomacy.', \"The PLA case illustrates how public attribution alone can have a deterrent effect when you are talking about world powers operating in the global community.  But it is easy to see why the same holds true in other contexts.  Even before an arrest, being publicly named and shamed creates risk of detention or arrest abroad.  It restricts liberty and travel.  But perhaps most important - hackers, like other thieves, are valued for their ability to get in and get out without getting caught.  Anonymity is the key to their livelihood.  Public attribution creates too much exposure.  It's a liability for the hacker and his business associates and can chill the marketplace for the hackers' services. \", \"Public attribution can also have a positive effect on victims and potential victims of cyber attacks.  Public attribution recognizes the victim's injury, validates their sense of violation and loss and reassures them that the U.S. government is dedicated to punishing the criminals who broke into their systems and stole their information.  It raises awareness of the threats we face, thereby encouraging resilience and hardened defenses.  And where the perpetrator is a sophisticated actor, like a nation state, it also levels the playing field.  Attribution can help demonstrate to victims that no criminal gets a free pass.\", 'But perhaps most importantly - investigations, and the ability to find out whodunit, facilitates the use of nearly every other tool in our toolbox to increase the cost of this behavior.  Sometimes those tools will be prosecution, sometimes sanctions, sometimes disruption operations, sometimes bilateral diplomacy.  But it will always require attribution.', 'To start, attribution empowers us to actively neutralize the threat.  Last year, for example, the Justice Department and the FBI obtained both criminal and civil orders to take down the GameOver Zeus botnet, employed by a criminal network responsible for an estimated $100 million in losses from businesses and consumers worldwide.', 'It also empowers us to bring national security solutions to national security problems, including diplomatic, financial and military responses.  Take the Sony hack.  Through close partnership with Sony, and through the hard work of the FBI, within weeks, we were able to attribute the hacks to North Korea.  Less than two months after the attack, the United States imposed sanctions on North Korea.', 'More broadly, in April of this year, the President issued an executive order that enables the Secretary of the Treasury to block the assets of persons who are engaging in malicious cyber-enabled activities that could threaten the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.  The order will allow us to hold accountable companies that knowingly receive or use trade secrets stolen through cyber-enabled means.  These beneficiary companies are taking advantage of the hard work of Americans and harming our competitiveness.  This executive order - and the consequences for entities sanctioned under it - should make companies think twice before hiring hackers or making use of information that they know was stolen.  But employing these authorities will only be possible through investigation and attribution.', \"Finally, attribution is crucial to effectively partnering with the private sector, especially in the context of information sharing.  The private sector is on the front lines of the fight for a secure Internet, and we rely on companies to keep the government informed.  If we don't even know that a cyber incident has occurred, we can do nothing to help - let alone identify the perpetrators.\", 'At the same time, the private sector relies on the government for information about the latest threats.  Sometimes, the government has access to the cyber threat signatures that private industry needs to defend itself.  In addition to the Department of Homeland Security, which runs the important Computer Emergency Readiness Team, the FBI works closely with the private sector through its InfraGard program, a public-private partnership with over 30,000 members.  The program securely distributes unclassified intelligence products relating to threats to critical infrastructure and allows affected stakeholders to report incidents directly to the FBI.  Furthermore, the FBI has, in the past year alone, presented over three dozen classified, sector-specific threat briefings to companies.', 'Conclusion', \"To conclude: the cyber threat is real and growing, but we are fighting back.  To deter malicious cyber actors - through prosecutions, public identification, disruptions, sanctions or improving the private sector's defenses - we must be able to attribute these activities back to the perpetrators.  And more often than not, attribution requires the work of lawyers and related professionals in the Department of Justice and the FBI.\", \"As you prepare for the start of your own legal careers, I ask all of you to consider working with us in this fight.  The threat is formidable, and to fight it we'll need help from the best.  I feel grateful every day for the opportunity I have: to enter public service and to become a lawyer in the Department of Justice.  It is a privilege.\", 'Once again, thank you for inviting me.  I look forward to your questions.']\n",

      "[\"Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch recognized 279 department employees for their distinguished public service today at the 63nd Annual Attorney General's Awards Ceremony.  Thirty-three other individuals outside of the department were also honored for their work.  This annual ceremony recognizes individuals for their outstanding service and dedication to carrying out the missions of the Department of Justice.  The department will also present one posthumous award in honor of Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells for his exceptional heroism in the line of duty.\", '\"The individuals being honored today stand out within a department that holds all of its employees and partners to an extremely high standard of excellence,\" said Attorney General Lynch.  \"They have put in long hours, made immense sacrifices and, in some cases, placed themselves in harm\\'s way.  They have taken on issues that once seemed intractable, and made progress on problems that once seemed impossible.  And their outstanding work is an inspiration to public servants everywhere.\"', \"The Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service is the department's highest award for employee performance and this year's award was presented to the team responsible for the thorough investigation of the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department.\", \"On Aug. 9, 2014, Ferguson Police Department Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.  The shooting immediately drew worldwide scrutiny, spawned weeks of unrest that resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency in Ferguson and the mobilization of the National Guard, which threatened to devolve into large-scale civil unrest.  Simultaneously, the case and aftermath spawned a national debate on the nature of the roles of race and class in policing.  Immediately following the shooting, the department's Civil Rights Division began criminal and civil investigations to uncover and analyze the facts surrounding the shooting and the broader practices of the Ferguson Police Department.  These reports were widely read, were published in the most prominent news sources around the world and were received as credible by community members and law enforcement alike.  The work of the recipients not only calmed the community, it set the framework for a groundbreaking project to improve police practices and police and community relations, while also reinforcing the credibility of the department by enforcing the civil rights of all Americans.\", \"The recipients of the Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service include, from the Office of the Attorney General, Counselor Benjamin C.

Simala.\", \"On March 10, 2015, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS)-Middle District of Louisiana was involved in a significant incident in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while attempting to arrest fugitive Jamie Croom during Operation Violence Reduction.  Croom was wanted on two counts of first degree murder and violation of his federal supervised release.  USMS personnel and Task Force Officers (TFO) responded to the Elm Grove Gardens Hotel in Baton Rouge in an attempt to arrest Croom.  Dressed in tactical attire with clearly marked law enforcement insignias, the entry team knocked and announced their presence when opening the door.  Law enforcement personnel proceeded into the room, at which time DUSM Wells was struck by gun fire initiated by Croom, who was hiding behind the hotel room door.  Law enforcement personnel immediately returned fire at the threat, striking Croom and subsequently restraining him.  Task force personnel immediately extracted DUSM Wells from the room to the parking lot and attempted to render first aid.  DUSM Wells was placed in a TFO's vehicle and transported to Lane Regional Medical Center in Zachary, Louisiana, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.\", 'On Nov. 19, 2014, SA Simala came to the aid of John Robert Phillips after he was involved in a horrific vehicle accident.  With complete disregard for his own personal safety, SA Simala was able to rescue an unconscious Phillips from his burning vehicle shortly before it became engulfed by flames.  Had SA Simala not acted, Phillips undoubtedly would have perished inside his burning vehicle.  During the incident, SA Simala suffered burns to his outer clothing, smoke inhalation and had several small and treatable glass cuts to his right hand.  Meanwhile, Phillips is said to be doing well and recovering from a shattered pelvis and two broken legs.', \"The Edward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrity is presented to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of former Attorney General Edward H. Levi, whose career as an attorney, law professor, dean and public servant exemplified these qualities in the best traditions of the department.  This year's award is presented to Charles E. Samuels Jr., Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\", \"Samuels is honored for his distinguished public service career.  He began his career as a correctional officer and moved through the ranks before becoming the eighth director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Dec. 21, 2011.  During his tenure as director, Samuels has significantly enhanced the operations of the largest agency in the department, thereby increasing public safety and reducing crime.  He has refreshed the country's largest corrections system, bringing a renewed emphasis to the department and administration priorities, such as the Smart on Crime Initiative, prisoner reentry, Children of Incarcerated Parents, evidence based approaches to programs, solid labor-management relations, transparency and ensuring the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars.  Samuels has made great strides in aligning the work of the department with the Bureau of Prisons' crime prevention mission through a variety of significant initiatives centered around enhancing safety of staff and inmates; increasing security and order inside federal prisons; increasing and improving inmate program offerings; realigning resources to increase efficiencies; increasing transparency with the public and stakeholders; enhancing labor-management relations; enhancing programs to strengthen bonds between incarcerated parents and their children; and expanding the use of sentence reduction mechanisms.

Lawton Lifetime Service Award is presented to Joyce R. Branda, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division's Commercial Litigation Branch.\", \"During her distinguished 30-year career in the Civil Division, Branda has consistently made significant contributions to the department's mission and its people, which led to her being selected in 2012 as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, the highest ranking career manager in the Civil Division.

As evidenced by his criminal history and previous arrests, Owens was an infamous thief with a complete lack of regard for public safety in his attempts to evade capture.  During the 48 hours prior to his capture, Owens led law enforcement officers on two vehicle pursuits, striking a dismounted task force officer with a stolen vehicle during one pursuit.  On June 18, 2014, the recipients captured and arrested Owens.', \"The Attorney General's Award for Meritorious Public Service is the top public service award granted by the department, and is designed to recognize the most significant contributions of citizens and organizations that have assisted the department in the accomplishment of its mission and objectives.  One Meritorious Public Service award is presented this year to Michael Lieberman, Washington Counsel and Director at the Anti-Defamation League Civil Rights Policy Planning Center.\", \"Lieberman is recognized for his significant contributions to the enactment and implementation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  Prior to its enactment in 2009, Lieberman was a major contributor to the act's development, both as policy counsel for the Anti-Defamation League and as the organizer and leader of the Hate Crimes Coalition, a working group of diverse non-governmental organizations (NGOs) representing communities across the nation.  Through his leadership in the coalition, Lieberman worked collegially and constructively with the department and Congress to secure passage of an effective and potent hate crimes statute.  Since its enactment in 2009, Lieberman has been an active and helpful community partner in the department's implementation and enforcement of the act.  He has worked with community groups and law enforcement across the nation to ensure that hate crimes are reported to law enforcement by working to build trust between community groups and local law enforcement through outreach and training events; expanding the Uniform Crime Report to collect hate crimes data on more religions; developing a law enforcement guide for identifying and reporting cases of hate crimes based on gender identity; providing active NGO participation in NGO/law enforcement joint hate crimes trainings across the nation; and filing amicus briefs in federal and state hate crimes cases on appeal that support the department's legal positions on the act.  Through these efforts and more, Lieberman has made significant contributions that assist the department in the accomplishment of its mission and objectives.\", \"The Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service is the Justice Department's second-highest award for employee performance.  The recipients of this award exemplify the highest commitment to the department's mission.  Twelve Distinguished Service Awards are presented this year to individuals or teams of people.\", \"The first Distinguished Service Award is presented to members of the team responsible for successfully litigating to enjoin anti-steering rules maintained by credit card companies.  This team is honored for its outstanding achievements in prevailing in one of the most significant and challenging cases the department's Antitrust Division has litigated in decades.  The Antitrust Division filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in October 2010 to enjoin anti-steering rules maintained by American Express, MasterCard and Visa that prevented merchants from encouraging consumers to use lower-cost forms of payment.  Because merchants had no ability under the defendants' rules to reward lower-cost credit card networks with increased transaction volume, the $50 billion in swipe fees that credit card networks collect from merchants each year were insulated from the forces of competition.  The recipients negotiated successful settlements with Visa and MasterCard but continued to litigate against American Express until the case proceeded to a seven-week trial before Senior U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Eastern District of New York in the summer of 2014.  In February 2015, Judge Garaufis found, after a full rule-of-reason analysis, that American Express violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  The team persuaded Judge Garaufis of American Express's liability in spite of complex two-sided platform issues associated with the payments industry, American Express's relatively low market share, and a determined defense by a well-financed defendant represented by lawyers from some of the country's most prestigious litigation firms.  Judge Garaufis complimented the parties for conducting the best trial he had ever presided.  In addition to the significant benefits that the team's success will bring to American consumers, it will also pay dividends for the division for many years as potential future defendants evaluate their risks of litigating against the Antitrust Division.\", 'Award recipients include, from the Antitrust Division, Litigation III Section Chief David Kully, Litigation III Section Assistant Chief Ethan Glass, Litigation III Section Trial Attorneys Craig Conrath, Andrew Ewalt, Mark Hamer, Gregg Malawer, Bennett Matelson, John Read, Lisa Scanlon, Joseph Vardner and Rachel Zwolinski, Networks and Technology Section Trial Attorney Ihan Kim, Competition Policy Section Economists Jeffrey Lien and Diane Owen and Economic Litigation Section Economist Deborah Minehart.', \"The second team to receive the Distinguished Service Award receives the award for its extraordinary work and exceptional service in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) investigation and litigation against Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) for its issuance of fraudulently inflated ratings of Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) in the run-up to the 2007 through 2008 financial crisis.  The investigation and litigation, coordinated with related civil actions by 19 states and the District of Columbia, led to a record $1.375 billion settlement, half of which ($687.5 million) constitutes a penalty to be paid to the federal government, and is the largest penalty of its type ever paid by a credit rating agency.  As part of the settlement, S&P admitted it ignored senior analysts within the company who complained it had given top ratings to financial products that were failing to perform as expected and it had declined to downgrade underperforming assets because it was worried that doing so would hurt the company's business.  While this strategy helped S&P avoid disappointing its clients, it did major harm to investors, including federally insured financial institutions that suffered losses exceeding $20 billion and to the larger economy, contributing to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  The litigation and its resolution provided further proof that the department will vigorously pursue investigations and litigation, no matter how challenging, to address misconduct that contributed to the financial crisis.\", \"Award recipients include, from the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Central District of California, Assistant U.

The operation, which involved coordination among more than 10 countries and dozens of private sector partners, wrested control of a global botnet that had stolen approximately $100 million from U.S. and European businesses and consumers and dismantled the computer infrastructure of a \"ransomware\" scheme that netted millions from victims by locking them out of their files until they paid a ransom to the criminals.  In connection with the takedown, a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh unsealed a 14-count indictment against Bogachev, charging him with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in connection with his alleged role as an administrator of the Gameover Zeus botnet.  Bogachev was also charged by criminal complaint in Omaha, Nebraska, with conspiracy to commit bank fraud related to his alleged involvement in the operation of a prior version of Gameover Zeus.  Although Bogachev remains a fugitive, he is on the FBI\\'s Cyber Most Wanted List and in March 2015, the FBI announced a $3 million reward for information leading to his arrest.', \"Award recipients include, from the National Security Division, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Luke Dembosky; from the National Security Division, Counterintelligence and Export Control Section Trial Attorney David Aaron; Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section Trial Attorneys Ethan Arenson and William A.

The ABT was a powerful, race-based Texas state-wide organization operating inside and outside state and federal prisons throughout Texas and the United States.  ABT protected its criminal money-making enterprises, including narcotics trafficking, identity theft, counterfeiting and check fraud, through assault, murder and other acts of violence while enforcing violent internal discipline.  In an investigation spanning six years and 17 separate indictments in five different federal districts, the recipients targeted the leadership and the most violent members and associates of the ABT.  Their work culminated in the indictment and conviction of 73 ABT members and associates on charges ranging from racketeering conspiracy, murder in aid of racketeering, narcotics trafficking, assault in aid of racketeering, firearms offenses and obstruction of justice.  This investigation and prosecution was exceedingly successful and the resulting convictions of every high ranking member of the ABT have effectively dismantled this violent criminal network.

The Nisur Square shooting was a watershed event for our nation\\'s involvement in Iraq and it presented a test as to whether the U.S. Criminal Justice System was capable of holding these American contractors accountable for their criminal acts overseas against foreign nationals.  It took seven long years to obtain the guilty verdicts in the case, during which time the team overcame complex legal challenges, which included a dismissal of the entire case by the district court and a successful appeal, daunting problems of proof arising from a factual scenario that the defendants characterized as a \"battlefield,\" and the enormous logistical and victim-witness challenges of bringing more than 40 Iraqi witnesses to the United States to testify at a time when Iraq was undergoing a particularly intense period of turmoil.

These efforts brought the owner and operator to justice through a cutting-edge criminal investigation and subsequent trial and pioneered the first-ever government-sponsored sale of bitcoins.  Silk Road was a sprawling, black market bazaar which operated on the \"dark web\" and required all transactions to be paid for in bitcoins, enabling its users to anonymously buy and sell illicit goods and services, including drugs, counterfeit IDs, computer hacking tools, pornography and weapons.  The team, which was nominated by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office of the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Marshals Service, led this extraordinary and groundbreaking effort by successfully navigating uncharted government territory and dismantling a notorious criminal enterprise of unprecedented scope and sophistication.

In 2011, the state of Maryland established a Prison Corruption Task Force for state, local and federal officials to share intelligence about high levels of gang activity in state correctional facilities.  Based on leads developed by the task force, federal agents and prosecutors used sophisticated investigative techniques to expose a widespread racketeering conspiracy in which leaders of Maryland's most prominent criminal gang corrupted correctional officers and exerted influence while incarcerated in the Baltimore City Detention Center.  The correctional officers smuggled contraband, drugs and cell phones into the facility and engaged in sexual relationships with gang members.  Gang leaders generated large profits by selling drugs and extorting payments from non-gang-affiliated inmates.  Using cell phones and electronic payment systems, gang leaders arranged to bribe correctional officers, purchase and sell drugs and transmit money outside the jail.  As a result of evidence gathered through multiple wiretaps, surveillance and cooperating witnesses, the team successfully prosecuted 40 defendants, including 24 correctional officers.  The team also worked closely with state correctional officials and other agencies to identify systemic weaknesses and develop effective reforms.  The shocking facts detailed in the charging documents prompted the state legislature to step in with enhanced oversight.

The investigation resulted in the complete dismantlement of the three largest smuggling networks on the Akwesasne, a designated high-intensity drug-trafficking area (HIDTA), with the leaders of all three organizations pleading guilty to continuing criminal enterprise charges and the conviction of Canadian drug kingpin Jimmy Cournoyer, leader of a Montreal-based criminal enterprise that worked directly with the Rizzuto Crime Family of the Montreal Mafia, the Hells Angels, the Bonanno Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico.

This marked the first-ever jury trial conviction under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.  The investigation uncovered a 20-year plan hatched by high-level PRC government officials to obtain E.l. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) trade secrets for the production of titanium dioxide (Ti02) and exploit its value through PRC state-owned enterprises.  Ti02 is a commercially valuable white pigment that is used in a multitude of products including paint, plastic and food items.  DuPont's unique process for creating Ti02 also creates a rare intermediary compound that has military and aerospace uses, such as coatings for ballistic missiles.  Transfer of these trade secrets to the PRC would have had an extremely negative impact on the United States' $13 billion per year Ti02 industry.

As a result of the investigation, OS dismantled 21 fraudulent treatment clinics operating in South Florida.  The case also charged 105 perpetrators operating at all levels of the fraud scheme, to include staged accident participants, patient recruiters, money launderers, licensed medical staff, true owners and doctors.  Seven of the most egregious chiropractors operating in Florida were charged federally, resulting in convictions and prison sentences for six of them; the seventh is an active fugitive.  Three doctors and a patient recruiter proceeded with a federal jury trial in March and April 2014, and were found guilty of 104 of the 105 charged counts.  The total federal prison time for those charged in the case exceeded 2,000 months and more than $92 million in restitution has been awarded to the victims.  The investigation and prosecution of OS eliminated the fraud that was being perpetrated by direct targets of the investigation; however, the greater accomplishments of the case were its broad-based deterrent effect on others in South Florida and the influence it had on state legislation.  One of the 49 victim insurance companies identified in the case reported a 61 percent decrease in PIP billings in Palm Beach County, Florida, between 2010 and 2014, representing a savings of over $21 million.  Throughout the case, members of the investigative team provided input through the National Insurance Crime Bureau to assist with legislative changes based on the scheme characteristics uncovered during the investigation.

The prosecution team proved that Torrez was also responsible for attacks on three young women in Arlington, Virginia, and the brutal murder of two young girls in Zion, Illinois, despite the fact that an innocent man stood accused of the Illinois killings for approximately five years.

La ONU's quest to maintain and increase their power of the drug trade led them to commit some of the most brazen murders seen in Puerto Rico, which cost the lives of ordinary law-abiding citizens.  Among the murders that the recipients proved during the trials was the downing of a police helicopter by a member of La ONU, who shot at the helicopter during flight with an AK-47 rifle, killing the co-pilot.  The recipients also proved the murder of a police woman and a librarian who were driving to work when they were caught in the crossfire and killed during a shootout between members of La ONU and their main rival.  In total, the team convicted seven defendants who were all sentenced to life in prison.  The defendants who were convicted included La ONU's leader and main enforcers.  As a result of the convictions obtained in the three trials, La ONU was significantly weakened.  Moreover, the conviction of the defendants involved in these murders brought peace to the citizens of Puerto Rico, as they would no longer be threatened by members of an organization whose brazenness put at risk the lives of law-abiding citizens.\", \"Award recipients include, from the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Puerto Rico, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Victor O. Acevedo-Hernandez and Jenifer Y. Hernandez-Vega.\", \"The second John Marshall Award for Support of Litigation is presented to Richard Farber, Senior Appellate Counsel in the Tax Division's Appellate Section.  Farber is presented this award for his exceptional record of accomplishments in support of litigation of the most important tax cases that are presented to the federal courts of appeals.  He has long been regarded as an appellate advocate of the highest caliber and for that reason he has, for many years, been asked to supervise the government's appellate litigation in the most important and complex tax cases.  Over the past two years alone, his astute supervision of the government's litigating strategy has saved more than $1 billion in revenue.  Moreover, Farber has made major contributions to the Tax Division's mission of protecting the public fisc.\", \"The first John Marshall Award for Handling of Appeals is presented to Vijay Shanker, Deputy Chief in the Criminal Division's Appellate Section.  Shanker is presented this award for his superlative skill in appellate advocacy.  Never flummoxed by a short deadline or a long dormant statute suddenly restored to life, he excels at solving puzzles and translating the solution into persuasive but crisp prose.  Shanker routinely handles complex cases requiring meticulous analysis, thorough research and an orderly, scholarly and clear presentation.  At oral argument, he knows that fist-pounding and hyperbole destroy credibility and that when representing the United States, earning the court's trust and respect is critical.  The soft-spoken Shanker earns that trust by anticipating the toughest questions and focusing on the key points needed to win.  With superlative skill and integrity, he has secured dozens of appellate victories for the government, defending the convictions of violent carjackers and robbers, fraudsters and corrupt public officials, drug dealers, narcoterrorists and criminals who exploit children.  He has also obtained several ground-breaking decisions on issues that lay at the intersection of forfeiture law, international relations and terrorism.  Additionally, Shanker finds time to provide legal advice to department's leadership and prosecutors on a variety of issues.\", \"The second John Marshall Award for Handling of Appeals is presented to the Bay Mills Indian Community team for its outstanding win in a case by the state of Michigan that presented a direct, frontal-assault on the concept of tribal sovereign immunity from suit in the absence of Congressional authorization.  Against a backdrop of bad facts in which to litigate this issue (apparently unlawful gaming by the tribe), the team presented cogent arguments as to why Congress had not authorized the kind of suit the state had brought and presented other clear avenues by which the state could obtain review of the legality of the tribe's actions without necessitating a complete revision of tribal sovereign immunity concepts.  Favorable decisions in the U.S. Supreme Court for Indian tribes have been quite scarce over the last decades.  This decision was a shining star, achieved because of the team's stellar work.\", \"Award recipients include, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division, the Office of the Assistant Attorney General-Senior Counsel for Indian Affairs Gina L. Allery, Indian Resources Section Deputy Chief John H. Turner Jr., and Appellate Section Assistant Chief William B. Lazarus and Attorney Mary Gabrielle Sprague; from the Office of the Solicitor General, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin S. Kneedler and Assistant to the Solicitor General Ann E. O'Connell.\", \"The first John Marshall Award for Providing Legal Advice is presented to the team responsible for guiding the department to its new position regarding Title VII and gender identity.  In December 2014, Attorney General Holder announced that it is now the view of the department that Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination reaches discrimination due to gender identity, gender transition and transgender status.  This announcement was the culmination of many years of not only legal analysis and internal discussion, but also outreach to stakeholders within the government and beyond.  Transgender individuals are among the most marginalized in our society, and thus they are sorely in need of the protections of federal antidiscrimination law.  Consequently, the significance of the department's change in position cannot be overstated.\", \"Award recipients include, from the Civil Rights Division, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gregory B. Friel and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pamela S. Karlan, and from the division's Appellate Section, Chief Diana K. Flynn, Deputy Chief Sharon M. McGowan, Special Litigation Counsel Tovah R. Calderon and Trial Attorney Holly Thomas.\", \"The second John Marshall Award for Providing Legal Advice is presented to the Justice Management Division's (JMD) Office of General Counsel (OGC) for providing exceptional, soundly reasoned and well researched legal advice to JMD staff and senior departmental and component leadership across the department.  Much of OGC's work is often behind-the-scenes, providing crucial support and confidence to leadership and components in the performance of their missions.  OGC's contributions to the department's nuts-and-bolts management issues, addressing all aspects of matters covering appropriations, personnel and appointments of officers, procurement, grant management, security, property management and department-wide directives are essential to the continued sound functioning of the department and effectuation of important policies and initiatives.  Additionally, through its effective coalitions with other federal agencies and interagency legal working groups, OGC is recognized and called upon by other agency general counsels and interagency legal working groups to provide invaluable assistance. \", \"Award recipients include, from JMD's OGC, General Counsel Arthur E. Gary, Deputy General Counsel Barbara A. Bush, Assistant General Counsels John R. Caterini, Kristen Bucher Hahn, Barry C. Hansen, Pamela J. Jadwin, Morton J. Posner, Evelyn S. Tang and John E. Thompson and Staff Assistant Michelle M. Allen.\", \"This year's John Marshall Award for Alternative Dispute Resolution is presented to Daniel Tenny, Trial Attorney in the Civil Division's Appellate Section.  Tenny is presented this award for achieving a groundbreaking settlement of much publicized litigation that was closely followed by veterans groups and members of Congress.  In Valentini v. McDonald, homeless veterans claimed, and the district court found, that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was improperly allowing land at its West Los Angeles Campus to be used for commercial purposes.  Tenny's intensive efforts over more than a year were central to the settlement, in which Tenny worked directly with the VA Secretary and disentangled the legal issues posed by the litigation from the substantive and policy issues on which the parties agreed.  The settlement has been lauded by commentators who had previously been critical of VA's operations in West Los Angeles as a new beginning and an opportunity to achieve significant policy objectives that would have been impossible if the parties had continued in an adversarial fashion.  The parties have already begun working together on new homelessness plans and on a process for making better use of the West Los Angeles campus, outside the context of any adversarial litigation.  Tenny achieved far more than could have been accomplished by success in the litigation and his work exemplifies the means by which the adversarial process can be transformed into a constructive endeavor.   \", \"This year's John Marshall Award for Interagency Cooperation is presented to Dustin F. Minor, Hazardous Waste Branch Chief in the Office of Regional Counsel - Region 9 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Minor has demonstrated extraordinary cooperation with ENRD's Environmental Enforcement and Environmental Defense Sections in connection with its joint efforts to pursue parties responsible for the contamination of over 500 abandoned uranium mines on Navajo Nation lands.  These abandoned mines have contaminated land near Navajo homes, roads, grazing lands and cultural areas, resulting in one of the most severe environmental justice problems in Indian Country.  Minor played an important role supporting the Environmental Defense Section in its ground-breaking work to craft a settlement with the Navajo Nation that will lead to the important response measures to address the uranium contamination resulting from mining on Navajo lands.  He has also played an essential role in the work of a combined EPA/department team to litigate against responsible private parties and to foster outreach to the Navajo Nation.  Minor played an equally central role helping litigate and settle consolidated Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act actions in connection with a 160-acre contaminated Superfund site in Rialto, California, litigation that was unusually challenging due to its extensive discovery and contentious disputes over its 10-year history.  Ultimately, five separate consent decrees were entered, which together will result in the cleanup of the entire site at a cost of approximately $100 million.  Minor played an important role in finding creative solutions that enabled both EPA and the U.S. Department of Defense to settle on terms that were appropriate to each agency.\"]\n"

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', \"Thank you to Peter [Neronha], for your warm introduction and to the Roger Williams University School of Law, for inviting me to today's event.  And thank you to all those in the audience - academics, students, policymakers, journalists and civil society - for your work in helping solve some of our most pressing cybersecurity issues. \", \"Today's event is well timed.  Last night, we unsealed a complaint charging Ardit Ferizi with hacking in support of ISIL.  We have long warned about the convergence of terrorism and the cyber threat, but this case is a first of its kind.  The complaint lays out probable cause to believe that Ferizi provided ISIL with the PII for over 1,000 U.S. government personnel, so that it could be used by ISIL against those individuals. \", 'But this case also illustrates how the threat continues to blend and blur.  As alleged, Ferizi provided material support to terrorism.  But the complaint also alleges conduct including hacking, identity theft and threats that basically amounted to extortion.', \"The complaint contains twitter screenshots, emails and logs that connect Ferizi not only to ISIL generally, but to Junaid Hussain specifically.  Hussain was involved in recruiting for ISIL and encouraged lone offenders to attack in the West until he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in August.  Hussain's tactics were not propaganda, not messaging - but a call to violence. \", 'As alleged, using the PII provided to him by Ferizi, Junaid Hussain tweeted the names, e-mail addresses, e-mail passwords, locations and phone numbers for approximately 1,351 U.S. military and other government personnel, with the threat that \"we are in your emails and computer systems, watching and recording your every move, we have your names and addresses, we are in your emails and social media accounts, we are extracting confidential data and passing on your personal information to the soldiers of the khilafah, who soon with the permission of Allah will strike at your necks in your own lands!\" ', 'Hackers a world away can intrude into our homes with the push of a button to steal from us, to gather intelligence that can be used against us and even to try hurt or kill us.  Stopping them requires cooperation, not only public-private, but also international.  This case required the assistance, close partnership and cooperation of authorities in Malaysia, for which we are grateful. ', 'This case is the first of its kind, but it is not unique.  Time after time, we have proven that the anonymity of the Internet is no safe haven.  No matter who poses the cyber threat - be it a terrorist today, the North Koreans in the Sony intrusion, the PLA in the Pittsburgh case, or the looming threats of tomorrow, we can and will find you.  And when we do, there will be consequences.  The all-tools approach we embrace allows us to be nimble - to bring the right tools to the fight that allow us to disrupt these threats. ', \"It is good to be in Rhode Island on a day like today.  This state is home to many cutting-edge cybersecurity practices.  Just this month, the Rhode Island Cybersecurity Commission released its first report and action plan for the development of cyber protection and resiliency in state government operations - a move that rightly recognizes that the answer to cyber threats does not lie solely at the federal level or with the private sector.  States play an integral role to keeping our nation's infrastructure and assets safe.   \", 'Rhode Island also benefits from a determined congressional delegation that champions cybersecurity and national defense issues.  The department has the privilege to work closely with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse in his role on the Judiciary Committee.  He has been a leader in this field, advocating for greater public-private information sharing and working to ensure that the Department of Justice has the legal tools necessary to combat national security cyber threats.  He also had tremendous foresight, long ago predicting that terrorist organizations would turn to online tactics to support or commit terrorism.  We have also been privileged to work closely with Senator Jack Reed on the Intelligence Committee and Congressman James Langevin, member of both Homeland Security and Armed Services Committees and a former member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, both of whom have shown strong leadership on issues of tremendous importance to the Department of Justice.', 'Today, as the threats we previously forecasted manifest themselves, and as future threats loom large, our collective work to deter and disrupt those who wish to do us harm becomes ever more important.  The threats we face today blur the lines between lone hackers and nation states and between criminal and national security threats.  And the threats we face tomorrow - including increasing threats from terrorists intent on using our own technology against us - illustrate why prevention is so important.', 'The Threats We Face', 'As a result of the proliferation of technology - and the myriad ways to exploit it - we face a changing world order in which lone hackers, organized crime syndicates and nation states are all increasingly able to harm our shared networks and our livelihood.  Every sector of the economy is a target - infrastructure, financial institutions, entertainment, agriculture, energy and more.', 'And hackers come in all shapes and sizes.  We have seen foreign, state-sponsored actors wage destructive attacks intended to coerce and intimidate.  For example, in the Sony attack, North Korean-sponsored hackers damaged computer systems, compromised valuable information, released corporate data and intellectual property at significant cost and threatened employees and customers.', 'We have also seen state and non-state actors using the Internet to steal our intellectual property and export-controlled information at unprecedented levels.  Similarly, we have seen an uptick in the theft of personally identifiable information in bulk quantities. ', 'A concerted series of malicious activity targeting OPM - the agency that manages personnel records for federal employees - resulted in the compromise of millions of sensitive records, including background investigation files for national security clearances.', \"Similar intrusions over the past two years have targeted several major health insurers' customer financial and medical information and even airline passenger travel reservation records.  Just last month, a New York Blue Cross Blue Shield provider revealed that it was the victim of a massive breach, exposing the data of more than ten million people.\", 'And now, we see ISIL crowdsourcing terrorism - using cyber intrusions to obtain information that, when placed in the hands of terrorists, could prove deadly.  But more than that, they use online tools to their advantage - leveraging social media to call for sympathizers worldwide to conduct attacks and conducting their operational planning through encrypted communications using mainstream technology.', 'All of this is to say we are on notice.  We are all targets. ', 'What lies around the corner?  Only time will tell, but where there is data, there is potential for dangerous manipulation, destruction and even death. ', 'In short, online threats of all types are increasing in frequency, sophistication and scope. ', 'As a result, we are most secure when the government, the private sector and academia work together to develop the strategies and best practices we can use on secure information access, threat detection and incident response.  Early incident reporting helps ensure we can identify who is behind an intrusion and impose consequences for their actions.  Sharing information helps us harden our defenses.  And when service providers understand how their services can be abused, they can take action to prevent it.  It is the responsible thing to do.  They can help prevent terrorist groups from abusing their services to induce recruits to commit terrorist acts.', 'This ongoing conversation is essential to keep our nation secure, to protect the privacy of our citizens, to enable American businesses to compete fairly in our global economy and to ensure that U.S. businesses and institutions are resilient in the face of cyber threats.  Because, while we gather here in Rhode Island to work together to make this country safer, our adversaries likewise gather to strategize against us. ', 'The Role of the National Security Division', 'Within the Justice Department, the National Security Division - or NSD - focuses on cyber threats to the national security - those posed by terrorists and nation states.', \"Our approach to these threats is rooted in our division's history.  NSD was created in response to the grave threat of terrorism.  After the devastating attacks of September 11th, it became clear that the Justice Department needed to reorganize to tackle terrorism and national security threats more effectively.\", \"We needed a single division to integrate the work of prosecutors and law enforcement officials with attorneys and analysts in the Intelligence Community.  So, nearly a decade ago, Congress created the department's first new litigating division in almost half a century: NSD.\", 'In the years after NSD was created, it became increasingly clear that the same things that motivated our creation and guided our efforts to combat terrorism were equally true in cybersecurity. ', \"In late fall of 2011, ten years after 9/11, we established a review group to evaluate NSD's existing work on national security threats and chart out a plan for the future.  Six months later, that team issued recommendations that shaped what NSD's national security cyber program looks like today.\", \"One of our first actions, in 2012, was to create and train the National Security Cyber Specialists' Network to focus on combating cyber threats to the national security.   This Network - known as NSCS - includes prosecutors from every U.S. Attorney's Office around the country, along with experts from the department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and attorneys from across all parts of NSD.\", 'We created the Network to bring criminal investigation and prosecution tools to bear on U.S. cybersecurity efforts.  And, in May 2014, the investment paid off.  The department announced unprecedented charges against five members of the Chinese military for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries.', 'But we also realized that prosecution is only one of the many tools the U.S. government brings to bear.  So NSD restructured and adapted to support a whole-of-government approach to national security cyber threats.  Criminal prosecution, sanctions, trade pressure and diplomatic options are just some of the responses available to us as we combat online threats to the national security.', 'Our attorneys live by that whole-of-government approach.  We work with our government partners to pick the best tool or combination of tools to get the job done under the rule of law. ', 'We ensure that we have the necessary expertise no matter who is behind the threat, what their motivation is, or what tool we need to use. ', \"Under unified NSD leadership, we have integrated the department's full range of national security expertise under one roof and we bring broad and varied skills and knowledge to cyber challenges. \", 'Our Response: U.S. Government All-Tools Approach', 'Our whole-of-government approach is calibrated to raise the costs of state-sponsored offenses against our nation.  We want to reach the point where the costs outweigh the benefits of targeting our systems and stealing our data. ', 'And we have recently seen encouraging developments in this area.  As just one example, last spring, our indictment of uniformed members of the Chinese military was met with denials, but no commitments.', 'China similarly objected when President Barack Obama signed an executive order that provides a new means to impose sanctions on individuals or entities that engage in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities that could threaten the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States.', 'But, during the historic state visit last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly declared that, \"China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.\"  And the United States and China agreed that neither country\\'s government will conduct, or knowingly support, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets or confidential business information with the intent of providing competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors. ', 'Our commitment to deterrence made a difference.  It was true when we said it in May 2014 following the PLA indictment and it remains true today: we are aware of no nation that publicly states that theft of information for commercial gain is acceptable.  And now, China has said for the first time that it will not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain.', 'What lies ahead remains to be seen.  As the President said, \"the question now is, are words followed by actions?\"  ', 'But, cyber security threats are not going away, and, when diplomacy fails, we remain committed to deterrence through the use of all available tools.', 'The criminal justice system will continue to be part of that strategy.  Even when indictments do not lead to defendants in courtrooms, they are valuable.  Indictments deter future would-be wrongdoers and reassure victims of online attacks that the U.S. government vindicates their rights.  Just as importantly, they help crystallize norms against this kind of behavior. ', 'The cyber executive order, which President Obama signed in April of this year, similarly helps us deter wrongdoers.  Of particular interest, the order will allow us to hold accountable companies that knowingly receive or use trade secrets stolen through cyber-enabled means.  These beneficiary companies are taking advantage of the hard work of Americans and harming our competitiveness.', \"This executive order - and the consequences for entities sanctioned under it - should make companies think twice before hiring hackers or making use of information that they know was stolen.  If they don't, we will take appropriate actions, which can include sanctioning those companies and cutting off their access to U.S. markets.  This is the same approach we have taken in counterterrorism and counter-proliferation.\", 'Some of the nations that steal from us also have obligations under international trade agreements, committing them to protect intellectual property rights.  Our colleagues in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative are currently exploring the tools at their disposal under those agreements, and whether the World Trade Organization and other forums could provide ways to challenge state-sponsored trade secret theft.  ', 'Public Private Partnership', 'Just as important as what the government does is the collaboration between government and the private sector.  After all, the Internet runs on private infrastructure and the hardware and software that we all use - including in the government - is developed and maintained by the private sector.', 'After an attack, if an organization works with law enforcement, it puts both in the best possible position to find out exactly what happened and to remediate and prevent further damage.  The evidence is often fleeting, so early notification and access to the data is extremely important.', \"In addition, we may have seen the same indicators of malicious activity in other attacks, so we can conclude who was responsible and identify possible impacts and means of remediation.  Importantly, it also allows us to share information with other potential victims.  One organization's vulnerability is everyone's vulnerability and it is critical that we work together. \", 'Law enforcement may be able to use legal authorities and tools that are unavailable to non-governmental entities.  Law enforcement can also enlist the assistance of international partners to locate stolen data or identify a perpetrator. ', 'These tools and relationships can greatly increase the odds of successfully apprehending an intruder or attacker and securing lost data.  Finally, this cooperation is vital to successful prosecutions that, as I explained, can prevent criminals from causing further damage to victim companies and others.', 'A united front is critical because the threat you face includes hackers with the full backing of their governments or that are part of sophisticated, international criminal syndicates.  They have backup, but so do you--because your government is here to help.', 'We recently announced a new position within NSD focused on outreach to the private sector.  This position was created in recognition of the importance of relationships and cooperation in cybersecurity.  We understand the importance of prevention and of resilience.  We want to support our private sector partners, whether they simply want to establish early lines of communication or call while under the strain of a continuing network breach.', 'As we face ever more threats in cyberspace, we must do more to ensure this public-private cooperation.  The conversations we have at these events are critical to keeping our nation secure and to protecting our privacy, our safety and our economic vitality.  The threats are not letting up and neither will we. ', 'Thanks again for inviting me. I look forward to your questions.']\n",

      "[\"Thank you, Ann [Beauchesne], for your warm introduction and for inviting me to today's event. \", 'The Chamber and its members are leaders in the national dialogue on cybersecurity challenges and solutions, demonstrating a strong commitment to educating executives about how to protect and defend businesses against cyber attacks.  And throughout its National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign, launched in May 2014, the Chamber has emphasized the importance of cyber risk management and cyber incidents reporting. ', 'That is why I am here for my fourth Chamber of Commerce cybersecurity event in 18 months.  The Chamber brings together private sector and government leaders to share information, learn from one other and develop the relationships needed to facilitate cooperation.  When we work together, our nation and our cybersecurity are stronger. ', 'And we must work together.  The cybersecurity threats we face are varied in scope and sophistication.  They affect our privacy, our safety and our economic vitality.  They present collective risk; disrupting them is our shared responsibility - a responsibility that is growing in complexity as the world we live in changes. ', 'Together, we have worked to bring about some of that change.  Through public-private cooperation and an all-tools strategy, we have raised the cost of cyber attacks and economic espionage, and made it clear that we will not tolerate the status quo. ', 'Our actions altered the dialogue, as we predicted they would. ', 'As just one example, last spring, our indictment of uniformed members of the Chinese military was met with denials, but no commitments. ', 'Fast forwarding just over one year, during a historic state visit last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly declared that, \"China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.\"  And the United States and China agreed that neither country\\'s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors. ', 'As the President noted, \"the question now is, are words followed by actions?\"  Only time will tell. ', 'Our commitment to deterrence has made a difference, but what lies ahead remains to be seen.  Cyber security threats are not going away.  We remain committed to deterrence through the use of all tools.  We will hold national security hackers to account, but we need your help. ', 'Sony and Sands', 'We have learned through experience the difference that cooperation makes.  Whether it is economic espionage or destructive malware, when your attacker has the power of a nation state, you need the power of a nation state to defend yourself.  And we, in return, need you.', \"The significance of today's venue cannot be overlooked.  We are here at the site of the first major nation state-sponsored destructive cyber attack in the U.S. because the leadership of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation wants to share lessons learned.  To help others avoid falling victim to such an attack.  In February 2014, Sands Corporation was hit with a cyber attack that froze the company and scared customers.  Ultimately, the intelligence community implicated Iran in the intrusion.\", 'In speaking to the management of Sands, they hoped that their misfortune would put the industry on notice that we are all targets.  Their hardship should be a wakeup call to others - to start preparing and building resilience now, before an attack takes place.', \"Just imagine - a call from your IT department telling you that you have minutes to decide whether to unplug your company's network or risk that the damage will spread.  Once you cross that threshold, forget about whether you can reach your businesses in another country, state or city.  Do you know how to reach key employees who are a few floors away, once you have no electronic address book, no lookup function on your phone?  Do you have a hard copy phone directory?  Very few companies can do business without their network.\", \"Also in 2014, while we were still investigating the unprecedented intrusion against Sands, the entertainment industry was hit again, when North Korean hackers attacked Sony Pictures Entertainment.  That attack got the world's attention.  It should now be clear that we are in a new world where national security threats hit the entertainment industry.  Sectors that never thought about the world of national security now must do so.\", 'But our response in these cases illustrates an important principle.  The government ought to help, and when victims come forward to work with us we can do just that. ', 'In both cases, the companies reported the incident promptly and worked closely with the FBI on a response.  Both companies have told us their decision to work with the FBI was the right one, and that it helped them weather trying events.', 'It took a year before the IC publicly implicated Iran in the Sands intrusion, but after Sony, in only a matter of weeks, we publicly named - for the first time - the nation-state responsible for a destructive attack on an American company. ', 'Attribution alone is significant, because attribution can be very difficult.  But it also allows us to take additional responsive actions with confidence.  These are national security problems.  With attribution, we can employ national security solutions.  That includes holding perpetrators accountable and increasing the cost until we reach the point where the costs outweigh the benefits of targeting our systems and stealing our data.', 'Whole-of-Government Strategy', 'The United States employs a comprehensive, all-tools approach to confront malicious actors who seek to harm critical infrastructure, damage computer systems and steal trade secrets and sensitive information.  We must hold attackers accountable and increase the cost of their activity.  Our work is designed to actively disrupt and deter nation states and terrorists until they stop stealing and waging bullying, destructive attacks. ', 'Whether you are the Syrian Electronic Army, North Korea, ISIL or a state-sponsored hacker, we can and will find you.  And when we do, there will be consequences.', \"For example, last year, we brought the first-ever charges against state-sponsored actors - five named members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Unit 61398 - for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at six American companies in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries.\", 'It was true when we said it in May 2014 following the PLA indictment, and it remains true today: we are aware of no nation that publicly states that theft of information for commercial gain is acceptable.  To the contrary, China has now said for the first time that it will not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain.', 'The criminal justice system is one central and effective component of this disruption effort.  Indictments and prosecutions are a clear and powerful way, governed by the rule of law, to legitimize and prove allegations.  They are necessary but not sufficient tools to bring to the fight.  We must apply our criminal justice tools along with the full range of legally available options to communicate our expectations regarding acceptable online behavior.  We must be strategic; we must evaluate all available options - law enforcement, intelligence, diplomatic, military and economic as appropriate - and use the most appropriate tool to respond.', 'For example, in the Sony matter, less than two months after the attack, the United States imposed sanctions on North Korea. ', 'Similarly, earlier this year, President Obama signed an Executive Order that provides a new means to respond to other significant online threats.  The executive order authorizes the government to impose sanctions on individuals or entities that engage in \"significant malicious cyber-enabled activities\" - activities that could threaten the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. ', 'Some of the nations that steal from us also have obligations under international trade agreements to protect intellectual property rights.  Our colleagues in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative are currently exploring the tools at their disposal under those agreements, and whether the World Trade Organization and other rules could provide ways to challenge state-sponsored trade secret theft.', 'Value of Partnership', 'But our tools are only one half of the equation.  We need your help.  Private sector partnership - the kind the Chamber of Commerce emphasizes - is crucial to us.  Next week, I will be in California with Sony CEO Michael Lynton to discuss the value of private-public partnerships to make our nation more secure.  We must get the word out. ', 'Because the threats we face are blurring the lines between lone hackers and nation states, and between criminal and national security threats, we are facing a changing world order in which lone hackers, organized crime syndicates and nation states are all increasingly able to harm our shared networks and our livelihood.  Every sector of the economy is a target -infrastructure, financial institutions, entertainment, agriculture, energy and more - no one is safe. ', \"But none of you should have to face that threat on your own, and you don't have to.  We are here to help.\", 'We share sensitive information with you so you can defend against or disrupt attacks before they happen or in real time.  In the past year alone, the FBI presented over three dozen classified, sector-specific threat briefings to companies. ', \"In addition, we can compare what we see to other attacks to help us identify who is responsible and possible means of remediation.  Importantly, it also allows us to share information with other potential victims.  One company's weakness is everyone's weakness, and it is critical that we work together. \", 'Finally, law enforcement may be able to use legal authorities and tools that are not available to you.

When attackers are linked to deep military budgets and resources, it is not a fair fight for the victim to face alone.  The pervasive mentality of blaming the victim of such an attack needs to change.  The focus should be on the response.  And we can work together on that response. ', 'When faced with a breach, your customers, employees and investors will want to know whether you did everything you could - including working with law enforcement.

      "[\"We welcome recent progress made with the People's Republic of China on cyber issues of concern to both the United States and China.  Through the efforts of President Obama and President Xi Jinping, as well as officials from both sides, we have made several key commitments focused on concrete actions and arrangements to address our differences on cyber issues.  These include:\", 'The United States and China committed that both sides should increase law enforcement communications regarding malicious cyber activities, including breaches of sensitive information, and provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning those activities.  Further, both sides agreed to provide updates to the other side on the status and results of those investigations and to take action, as appropriate. ', 'As a means of ensuring that these commitments are upheld and responses are provided in a timely and comprehensive manner, the United States and China committed to establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on cybercrime and related issues.  We will co-chair the dialogue for the United States, with participation from representatives of the FBI, the U.S. Intelligence Community and other agencies.  China will designate an official at the Ministerial level to lead representatives from the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Justice and the State Internet and Information Office.  This dialogue will enable both sides to periodically assess our progress; address any issues related to investigative cooperation or information exchanges; and outline means for relevant agencies on both sides to enhance cooperation.  Further, the two countries will establish a hotline to address urgent issues or difficulties that have not otherwise been successfully resolved.  We look forward to scheduling the first session of this dialogue before the end of the calendar year.', 'We intend to remain personally engaged on these issues to ensure that both sides take concrete and reciprocal steps to advance progress made thus far.  These commitments do not resolve all our challenges with China on cyber issues.  However, they do represent a step forward in our efforts to address one of the sharpest areas of disagreement in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.  The United States is prepared to fulfill our commitments and make reciprocal efforts.  We expect China to do the same and have been clear with the Chinese government that their words must be matched by actions.']\n",

      "['Thank you for that introduction, David [Hickton]. ', 'And thank you to the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) for organizing this Executive Summit.  Since 1997 - long before the cybersecurity conversation was in the forefront of American minds and back when one of the biggest threats to industry was spam - NCFTA has been a leader in bringing together law enforcement, private industry and academia to share information to stop emerging cyber threats and mitigate existing ones.  Today, nearly two decades later, as the threats we face have grown to include malware, nation state-sponsored theft and critical infrastructure attacks, among many others, your work has become only more important. ', 'You should be commended - not only for the work you do each and every day, but for your foresight.  You recognized long ago that we are most secure when the government and private sector share strategies and best practices on secure information access, threat detection and incident response.  As a result, you created the model that others should follow. ', \"Discussions like this one today, and the collaboration you undertake on a daily basis, allow us to learn from one another, so that the same actors, using the exact same tools and signatures, cannot simply move to a new victim when they have been kicked out of another organization's network.\", \"And that is both critically important and incredibly urgent.  Because while we gather here in Pittsburgh to work together to make this country safer, our adversaries likewise gather together to strategize against us.  Nation states have developed entire economic espionage campaigns against us and our corporations - relying on their own kind of public-private partnerships to do us harm.  Right now, other nations' governments issue their own calls to action, threatening our livelihood, our economic security and our safety.\", 'That is why this conversation is so important.  To keep our nation secure, to enable American businesses to compete fairly in our global economy and to ensure we have an early warning system to help mitigate threats, we need to work together.  When a foreign government attacks, private industry cannot and should not go it alone.  Your own government ought to help you.  And we will.', 'The Role of the National Security Division', \"That is precisely why the Department of Justice's National Security Division - or NSD, for short - was created. \", 'After the devastating attacks of September 11th, it became clear that the Justice Department needed to reorganize to tackle terrorism and national security threats more effectively.', \"We needed a single division to integrate the work of prosecutors and law enforcement officials with attorneys and analysts in the Intelligence Community.  So, nearly a decade ago, Congress created the department's first new litigating division in almost half a century: NSD.\", 'In the years since NSD was created, it has become increasingly clear that the same things that motivated our creation and guided our efforts to combat terrorism were equally true in the cybersecurity realm.  We have a host of tools available to us to combat online threats to the national security - criminal prosecution, sanctions, designations and diplomatic options - and we have the ability to pick the best tool or combination of tools to get the job done under the rule of law. ', 'Our attorneys live by that approach.  We use all available tools to combat online threats to the national security and have ensured that we have the necessary expertise no matter who is behind the threat, what their motivation is, or what tool we need to use.  Under unified NSD leadership, we have integrated the full range of national security expertise of the department under one roof and we bring broad and varied skills and expertise to cyber issues.  And we created the nation-wide NSCS Network, which consists of over 100 specially-trained federal prosecutors in every jurisdiction, who focus on combating online threats to the national security.', 'The Threats We Face', 'That integration is critical as we face an onslaught of new threats and intrusions that raise national security concerns. ', 'In the Sony hack late last year, we saw a foreign, state-sponsored actor wage a destructive attack intended to chill the speech of a company in the United States and U.S. citizens.  The Sony attack was perpetrated by North Korean-sponsored hackers who destroyed computer systems, stole valuable information, released corporate data and intellectual property at significant cost and threatened employees and customers.', 'As a hybrid threat, presenting national security and criminal concerns, we see both state and non-state actors using the Internet to steal our intellectual property and export-controlled information at unprecedented levels.  As the President said recently, industrial espionage and the theft of trade secrets is fundamentally different from the traditional intelligence-gathering functions that all states engage in.  China\\'s campaign to steal trade secrets and other proprietary information is \"an act of aggression that has to stop.\"  As the world\\'s two largest economies, the United States and China have a vested interest in working together on this issue.  President Obama is prepared to address these issues with the Chinese, recently saying that \"this will probably be one of the biggest topics that [he will] discuss with President Xi\" during the upcoming visit.  Just this week the Wall Street Journal published a transcript of an interview with Chinese President Xi Jinping in which he agreed that cyber theft of commercial secrets and hacking attacks against government networks are both illegal. ', 'Similarly, we have also seen an uptick in the theft of personally identifiable information in bulk quantities.  A concerted series of malicious cyber activity targeting OPM - the agency that manages personnel records for federal employees - resulted in the compromise of millions of sensitive records, including background investigation files for national security clearances.', \"Similar intrusions over the past two years have targeted several major health insurers' customer financial and medical information and even airline passenger travel reservation records.  Just this month, a New York Blue Cross Blue Shield provider revealed that it was the victim of a massive breach, exposing the data of more than 10 million people.\", 'The challenge transcends this rampant information theft, as malicious actors are seeking to build the capabilities and develop the access necessary to disrupt United States critical infrastructure.', \"In short, online threats of all types are increasing in frequency, sophistication and scope.  And these threats are occurring against a background of increasing worry about the nation's overall network security.  The past year has seen the announcement of several significant software vulnerabilities - some now so famous that they have their own brand names, such as Heartbleed, Shellshock and Stagefright. \", 'This year, the Department of Homeland Security\\'s Computer Emergency Readiness Team published a list of 30 \"high risk vulnerabilities\" that, according to DHS, are exploited in \"[a]s many as 85 percent\" of attacks on critical infrastructure organizations.  These included several software vulnerabilities that were disclosed years ago, including one as far back as 2006.  This means that companies are not falling victim to new and unidentified exploits, but rather, to vulnerabilities that have been known for almost a decade. ', \"Finally, new threats appear on the horizon.  We know that terrorists seek to exploit our reliance on weak or outdated network security to harm our way of life.  To date, terrorist groups are largely experimenting with hacking, but this could serve as the foundation for developing more advanced capabilities.  We've also seen calls to action through Internet jihad by both Al Qaeda and ISIL and our international partners have experienced attacks conducted by purported jihadists.  We are concerned those groups will not hesitate to deploy offensive capabilities if they are able to acquire them.\", 'The threat from these terrorist organizations has a second and equally troubling dimension: unprecedented and sophisticated use of social media to radicalize and recruit new associates for heinous attacks. ', \"Al Qaeda was very guarded with its brand and selective in its recruiting; by contrast, ISIL blasts out tens of thousands of social media messages daily, calling for sympathizers worldwide to act in ISIL's name - at a time, place and method of the attacker's choosing.  ISIL claims credit, whether successful or not. \", 'Although ISIL uses social media and open platforms for recruitment, they conduct their operational planning through encrypted communications using mainstream technology.  It is important that those providing the services take responsibility for how their services can be abused.  Responsible providers need to understand what the threats are and to take action to prevent terrorist groups from abusing their services to induce recruits to commit terrorist acts.', 'Our Response: U.S. Government All-Tools Approach', \"This audience knows all too well that adversaries with extensive resources can pose a serious threat to anyone's network.  Our collective response must extend beyond awareness campaigns and scanning e-mail for phishing attacks.  We also need the ability - after a sophisticated hacker has gotten in - to detect and disrupt that attacker.  Then, we need to respond to the attack in a way that will deter future foes.\", 'The government must take concrete and decisive action to respond to these threats.  Along with our partners in other federal, state, and local agencies, we intend to raise the costs of state-sponsored offenses against our nation, both for targets in government and the private sector.  We want to reach the point where the costs outweigh the benefits of targeting our systems and stealing our data. ', \"For example, last year, here in Pittsburgh, we brought the first-ever charges against state-sponsored actors - the five named members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Unit 61398 - for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at six American companies in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries.    \", 'It was true when we said it in May 2014 following the PLA indictment, and it remains true today: we are aware of no nation that publicly states that theft of information for commercial gain is acceptable.  It is time for us to, once and for all, come to a common agreement about acceptable state behavior on the Internet.  Ambassador Susan Rice recently reiterated this point in a speech at the George Washington University, stating that, \"Cyber-enabled espionage that targets personal and corporate information for the economic gain of businesses undermines our long-term economic cooperation and it needs to stop.\" ', 'And, when those norms are not abided by, we must hold responsible individuals and entities accountable and increase the costs of their activity. ', \"The need to increase the costs of malicious activity online is especially obvious in light of the destructive acts targeting Sony Pictures.  North Korea's use of computer network attacks to destroy computer systems and deter and punish Americans from exercising their First Amendment rights is unacceptable and indefensible. \", 'Only weeks after the attack, we were able to publicly attribute that a nation-state was responsible.  That, alone, is significant, because attribution can be very difficult.  Unlike terrorists, who claim credit for attacks, our online adversaries often try to hide their conduct.  Of course, naming those responsible publicly is only the first step. ', 'This is a national security problem, and it demands a national security solution.  That includes holding perpetrators accountable and increasing the cost of their activity in other ways as well.  Until nation states and terrorists stop stealing and waging bullying, destructive attacks, we must actively disrupt and deter them. ', 'Whether you are the Syrian Electronic Army, North Korea, ISIL or a state-sponsored hacker, we must demonstrate that we can and will find you.  And when we do, there will be consequences. ', 'The United States is pursuing a comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to confront malicious actors who seek to harm critical infrastructure, damage computer systems and steal trade secrets and sensitive information. ', 'The criminal justice system is a central and effective component of this disruption effort.  Indictments and prosecutions are a clear and powerful way, governed by the rule of law, to legitimize and prove allegations.  It is a necessary but not sufficient tool to bring to the fight. ', 'But it is not the only tool we possess to communicate our expectations regarding acceptable online behavior.  We must be strategic; we must evaluate the full range of options - law enforcement, intelligence, diplomatic, military and economic - and use the most appropriate tool to respond.', 'Earlier this year, President Obama signed an Executive Order that provides a new means to respond to significant online threats.  The executive order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to impose sanctions on individuals or entities that engage in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities - that could threaten the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States. ', 'Of particular interest, the order will allow us to hold accountable companies that knowingly receive or use trade secrets stolen through cyber-enabled means.  These beneficiary companies are taking advantage of the hard work of Americans and harming our competitiveness. ', \"This executive order - and the profound consequences for entities sanctioned under it - should make companies think twice before hiring hackers or making use of information that they know was stolen.  If they don't, we will take appropriate actions, which can include sanctioning those companies and cutting off their access to U.S. markets.  This is the same approach we have taken in counterterrorism and counter-proliferation.\", 'Some of the nations that steal from us also have obligations under international trade agreements, committing to protect intellectual property rights.  Our colleagues in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative are currently exploring the tools at their disposal under those agreements, and whether the World Trade Organization and other rules could provide ways to challenge state-sponsored trade secret theft.  ', 'Importance of Private-Public Sector Partnership', 'Despite our ability and willingness to deter this conduct, no one is immune from malicious cyber activity.  We know that we will never achieve impenetrable defenses - no network wall is high enough to keep a determined, sophisticated actor out of our systems. ', 'But you can take steps to mitigate the risk, and protect yourselves and your companies.  Part of the response must be to ensure that that your systems are resilient to attacks.', \"And, it is crucial that you not go it alone.  This challenge requires a new kind of partnership between the government and industry - such efforts will be crucial to defending our companies and our citizens from these threats.  For the government's part, we are committed to building this partnership.\", 'We currently share sensitive information with you so you can defend against attacks in real time and engage in disruption efforts.  In the past year alone, the FBI presented over three dozen classified, sector-specific threat briefings to companies, but we need to keep getting better.', \"We're working to lower the barriers to information sharing even further.  At the Department of Justice, for example, we've clarified that certain laws are not impediments to sharing information with the government to protect against cyber threats. \", \"The Department's Antitrust Division published guidance reaffirming that companies who engage in properly designed threat information sharing will not run afoul of antitrust laws and the Criminal Division published guidance to help clarify that companies can and should share certain aggregated threat information with the government.\", 'We also continue to work with Congress to improve and update the legal framework for sharing threat information.', 'After an intrusion or attack, if a company works with law enforcement, it puts us both in the best possible position to find out exactly what happened and to remediate and prevent further damage.  The evidence is often fleeting, so early notification and access to the data is extremely important. ', \"In addition, we may have seen the same indicators of malicious activity in other incidents, so we can conclude who was responsible and identify possible impacts and means of remediation.  Importantly, it also allows us to share information with other potential victims.  One company's vulnerability is everyone's vulnerability and it is critical that we work together. \", 'The Department of Justice may be able to use legal authorities and tools that are unavailable to non-governmental entities.  As a government, we can also enlist the assistance of international partners to locate stolen data or identify a perpetrator. ', 'These tools and relationships can greatly increase the odds of successfully apprehending an intruder or attacker and securing lost data.  Finally, this cooperation is vital to successful prosecutions or other enforcement actions that can prevent criminals from causing further damage to victim companies and others.  Prosecutions, sanctions and other steps will help deter would-be hackers.', \"A united front is critical because the threat you face includes hackers with the full backing of their governments and hackers that are part of sophisticated, international criminal syndicates.  You shouldn't have to face those threats on your own and you don't have to.  We are here to help.  At the same time, it is increasingly clear that dealing with expanding cyber threats must be a team effort.  You bring vital expertise and information to the effort, just as the government brings essential resources and capabilities.\", 'There are many good sources of recommendations concerning how to respond to breaches across the U.S. government, including DHS and NIST.  Within the Department of Justice, our Criminal Division recently issued \"Best Practices for Victim Response and Reporting of Cyber Incidents.\"  It covers a number of subjects, but let me highlight one of its key takeaways: When companies suffer a breach, they immediately face a host of difficult choices, and that reality is not lost on us. ', 'We understand that the decision whether to call law enforcement, in particular, is difficult.  Companies must weigh numerous considerations that can seem to cut in opposing directions.  What are the ramifications of publicizing this breach?  Will employees be embroiled in lengthy legal proceedings?  Will the government treat my confidential and proprietary information with the care and discretion it deserves? ', 'We understand these concerns, and we can assure you that we will roll up our sleeves and work with you to try to satisfy them.  We understand also that your customers, employees and investors, when they finally do learn of a breach, will also ask you whether you worked with law enforcement.  Increasingly, they see that as a necessary step; they want to know that you are doing everything you can to address the breach, including informing law enforcement.', 'To repeat what I said at the outset: We are in this fight together.  As you work to make your organizations succeed and to protect their assets from adversaries - both state-sponsored and otherwise - always keep in mind that we in government stand ready to assist your efforts.', 'Thank you again for having me.  I look forward to your questions.']\n"

The stolen trade secrets alleged in the indictment belong to Avago or Skyworks.', \"Avago is a designer, developer and global supplier of FBAR technology, which is a specific type of radio frequency (RF) filter.  Throughout Zhang's employment, Skyworks was also a designer and developer of FBAR technology.  FBAR technology is primarily used in mobile devices like cellular telephones, tablets and GPS devices.  FBAR technology filters incoming and outgoing wireless signals so that a user only receives and transmits the specific communications intended by the user.  Apart from consumer applications, FBAR technology has numerous applications for a variety of military and defense communications technologies.\", 'According to the indictment, in 2006 and 2007, Pang, Zhang and other co-conspirators prepared a business plan and began soliciting PRC universities and others, seeking opportunities to start manufacturing FBAR technology in China.  Through efforts outlined in the superseding indictment, Pang, Zhang and others established relationships with officials from Tianjin University.  Tianjin University is a leading PRC Ministry of Education University located in the PRC and one of the oldest universities in China.', 'As set forth in the indictment, in 2008, officials from Tianjin University flew to San Jose, California, to meet with Pang, Zhang and other co-conspirators.  Shortly thereafter, Tianjin University agreed to support Pang, Zhang and others in establishing an FBAR fabrication facility in the PRC.  Pang and Zhang continued to work for Avago and Skyworks in close coordination with Tianjin University.  In mid-2009, both Pang and Zhang simultaneously resigned from the U.S. companies and accepted positions as full professors at Tianjin University.  Tianjin University later formed a joint venture with Pang, Zhang and others under the company name ROFS Microsystem intending to mass produce FBARs.', 'The indictment alleges that Pang, Zhang and other co-conspirators stole recipes, source code, specifications, presentations, design layouts and other documents marked as confidential and proprietary from the victim companies and shared the information with one another and with individuals working for Tianjin University.', 'According to the indictment, the stolen trade secrets enabled Tianjin University to construct and equip a state-of-the-art FBAR fabrication facility, to open ROFS Microsystems, a joint venture located in PRC state-sponsored Tianjin Economic Development Area (TEDA), and to obtain contracts for providing FBARs to commercial and military entities.', 'The six indicted defendants include:', 'The maximum statutory penalty for each of the charges alleged in the superseding indictment is as follows:', 'Zhang was arrested on May 16, 2015, upon landing at the Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from the PRC.  He made his initial appearance yesterday afternoon in Los Angeles before the U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia G. Rosenberg of the Central District of California, who ordered the defendant transported in custody to San Jose for further proceedings.  His next scheduled appearance will be before the U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila of the Northern District of California, at a date to be determined.', 'The charges contained in an indictment are merely accusations, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

      "[' This important event is an opportunity to discuss a broad range of issues associated with cross-border mergers--including how, together, we can protect national security while promoting foreign investment and supporting economic growth. The U.S. Government encourages foreign investment, and understands its importance in the global marketplace. We understand its potential to help companies increase market share, to promote and drive innovation, and to create additional jobs both here and abroad. That said, as we operate within the global marketplace and welcome foreign investment, we must also identify and address potential vulnerabilities introduced by cross-border transactions. Because, with an ever-growing and evolving set of threats targeting our sensitive technologies and information, we must be vigilant.   We must look for how transactions could make us more vulnerable, and do everything in our power to mitigate those vulnerabilities. That goal is what motivates, in part, the set of complex legal regimes governing foreign investment and global transactions.   It may seem daunting at times, but it exists to protect our national security and our national interests.   And that set of regimes is only one piece of the puzzle. In today\\'s world, we must look beyond the law governing transactions to the full range of laws designed to protect our national security. At the Department of Justice\\'s National Security Division, or \"NSD,\" we do just that.   We protect national security by taking an intelligence-driven, threat-based approach. We know from experience that those seeking to do us harm will look for any available vulnerability to exploit.   It is our responsibility to use all tools available to us to prevent them from doing so. As professionals handling all of the intricacies of global business deals, you share that responsibility.   In many ways, you are on the front lines of our national defense. In conducting thorough due diligence in connection with a deal, you may be in the best position to identify where we may become more vulnerable.   You may also be in the best position to help minimize our risk.   And that can be a big responsibility on your part. To fulfill that responsibility, it is important to broaden the scope of issues we currently think about in connection with cross-border mergers.   To do this, we need to consider the full range of threats. We need to put the foreign investment review process into a broader context.   We live in an interconnected world, in which exploitation of security vulnerabilities can lead to corporate theft, the violation of export control laws, or even physical damage or loss of life. We face a wide range of evolving threats, including those posed by well trained, highly skilled, state-sponsored cyber actors. These are challenging times.   We must be vigilant.   And we must keep our eyes open, looking for potential vulnerabilities and working to mitigate them to keep our innovation, our technologies, and our nation safe.    The National Security Division Before addressing this broad set of issues, I want to give you a sense of NSD and our approach to protecting the nation. NSD was created in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks.   Those attacks showed us the dangers of putting walls up between foreign intelligence and law enforcement.   By doing so, we made connecting the dots of a plot very difficult.   We needed to change. With the crumbling of this intelligence wall, we recognized that we needed to unite prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the Intelligence Community.   In 2006, Congress created NSD, bringing all of the Department\\'s national security work into a single unit, and giving the Department its first new litigating division in almost half a century. Lawyers in our Division play a critical role in shaping our country\\'s toolsets, options, and solutions to various security challenges. In particular, NSD works on three specific areas related to protecting national security while at the same time promoting foreign investment:', '    1.      First,  our Foreign Investment Review Staff, or \"FIRS,\" is the Department\\'s representative to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews certain foreign investments for national security concerns.', '    2.      Second,  we handle cases involving violations of export control laws.', '    3.      Third, we also handle cases of economic espionage. ', '     CFIUS', \"  I'm not planning to spend much time today on NSD's CFIUS-related work.   For one thing, I know most of you are familiar with the CFIUS process, and you'll hear more about it throughout the rest of this conference.   And we can't discuss particular transactions, because they are subject to confidentiality provisions by statute. Let me simply say that, as one of the member agencies of CFIUS, DOJ takes very seriously our collective statutory obligation to protect national security if a risk is posed by a transaction that could result in foreign control of a U.S. business.   We do this in the context of America's longstanding open investment policy, which has proven so beneficial to economic growth and job creation.   By focusing solely on potential national security concerns, we maintain that policy while protecting against risk in transactions under CFIUS's purview.   CFIUS conducts thorough and rigorous national security reviews of such transactions; and, if the transaction presents a risk, the statute gives us the tools we need to address it.   If it doesn't present such a risk, we not only clear the transaction; we welcome it. Separate from CFIUS, NSD considers national security threats or concerns from many types of foreign economic activity in the United States.   We approach such threats using all available tools.   In keeping with the theme of this conference, I intend this morning to broaden the range of national security issues that we associate with foreign investment by discussing those other threats and tools.\", \"     Export Control For example, as many of you are aware, the United States regulates, in the interests of national security, the export of sensitive equipment, software, and technology. As a country, we want our leading industrial and technological companies to profit from exports.   Our economy relies to a great extent on exports, and we want to support those sales. We find ourselves in a position where we must balance that desire to support our economy with recognition of the real threat to national security posed by certain technologies falling into the wrong hands. The complex export control regime thus exists for good reasons, such as to prevent weapons of mass destruction from ending up in the hands of terrorists and other adversaries. These controls and regulations protect advanced but sensitive equipment, software, and technology from finding their way to individuals who could use our innovation to do us and others harm. Three Government entities have the authority to issue export licenses: the Departments of State, Commerce, and Treasury.   And their work in this area is significant. In one year alone, these three Departments processed over 130,000 applications.   Most of those applications receive approval.   However, there are limits, and for certain narrow categories of products and technologies, going to a few identified places, the national security threats posed are simply too great to take the risk. That is why violating the laws associated with protecting export-controlled information is a serious crime. To illustrate, in 2012, Pratt & Whitney Canada Corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act and making false statements.   The companies involved agreed to pay millions of dollars as part of a global settlement with the Justice Department and State Department. These pleas resulted from the illegal export to China of U.S.-origin military software used in the development of China's first modern military attack helicopter, the Z-10. Pratt & Whitney decided, on its own, that development engines for the Z-10 did not require a U.S. export license. They were wrong, and it was an expensive mistake on their part. The companies failed to disclose their illegal exports for several years, and finally did so only after an investor group queried one of the companies about whether it might be engaging in illegal activity. The companies then made a number of submissions to the State Department--submissions that contained numerous false statements. Thanks in part to the hard work of prosecutors at NSD, we obtained this landmark guilty plea and settlement. You can see how facilitating the development of China's first modern military attack helicopter is cause for concern.   That is precisely the sort of technology transfer that our export control regime prohibits.   And it's why we continue to enforce that regime vigorously and punish those who violate it. Consider the charges that we announced in April against Karl Lee.   Lee was charged with violating sanctions prohibiting certain financial transactions with proliferators of weapons of mass destruction.   The charges allege that Lee spun a web of front companies to carry out prohibited transactions essentially in disguise. Or consider the charges against Parviz Khaki.   The indictment against Khaki alleges that he worked to obtain, and illegally export to Iran, U.S.-origin materials that can be used to construct gas centrifuges to enrich uranium.   Khaki was arrested in the Philippines, and we are awaiting his extradition. As part of our all-tools approach, we will keep bringing charges like these to uphold laws cutting off transactions that threaten our national security.\", '     FCPA Before I turn from export control to economic espionage, I should note another important consideration in cross-border transactions that our DOJ colleagues outside NSD handle: criminal enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   Much as export control and economic espionage can, in many instances, be a form of white-collar crime, so, too, are FCPA violations white-collar offenses. The FCPA makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals, as well as foreign companies and individuals in certain instances, to offer, promise, or pay bribes, directly or indirectly, to foreign officials to obtain a business benefit.   And it can apply to practices that some foreign companies might regard as business as usual--at their peril. So, I urge you, as part of assessing any deal, to ensure that you consider how a transaction might trigger applicability of the FCPA, and in turn how you can help ensure compliance with it.   Like the export control regime, the FCPA regime is, in some ways, distinctively American.   In turn, any client doing business here must receive legal guidance to ensure compliance--or face serious consequences.', \"     Economic Espionage Like export control violations, economic espionage poses a significant threat to national security. When certain foreign entities eager for sensitive and valuable information can't buy it through exports or acquire it through a transaction, they may take another approach: they try to steal it. Corporate theft may occur through insiders employed by a company involved in a transaction.   Or it may occur remotely, through cyber intrusions that exploit a vulnerability present in one of the companies' networks. As one example of the insider threat, in March, we successfully obtained a significant conviction for economic espionage involving a former DuPont employee named Robert Maegerle [MUH--GURL]. Walter Liew, an electrical engineer, obtained one of DuPont's secrets from Maegerle.   The two of them stole information about a process, honed over many decades, for making a multi-purpose white pigment.   Liew passed this stolen trade secret to a large Chinese state-owned company. What Maegerle and Liew stole was something Americans see and use daily.   Something that, on its own, does not have a national security implication. Maegerle and Liew stole the formula for the color white.   They committed economic espionage, pure and simple. They stole a trade secret worth billions to DuPont and received more than $20 million in compensation, an incredible return on investment for the Chinese state-owned company. We brought Maegerle and Liew to justice in the U.S. criminal justice system.   They await sentencing later this month. Enforcement of economic espionage laws is another important means to ensure that foreign actors don't steal the valuable intellectual property created by Americans. And, as companies move to digital storage, economic espionage increasingly occurs not just through insider threats but also through cyber activity. In cross-border transactions, the cyber security practices of the acquiring company are critical to the overall evaluation of potential national security vulnerabilities.   That's because, even if an acquiring company itself has no intent to steal critical information or technology, if its cyber security practices will leave us vulnerable to others who do, we must act to protect national security. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of cyber security as a consideration in foreign investment transactions.   The cyber threat, especially from nation states, is staggering. You could envision how nation states might seek to acquire telecommunications and other cyber-related infrastructure or services to provide them with access to U.S. communications or information. That's why a critical component of our mitigation efforts through CFIUS, for example, is to require--when necessary--certain cyber security policies and procedures aimed at ensuring that a foreign acquirer imposes adequate practices. But we also know that, more broadly, state-sponsored actors may exploit vulnerabilities in cyber security. Envision a transaction involving a company that sets up computer infrastructure for other companies, where the acquiring company is based in a friendly nation. However, if that acquiring company has less-than-stellar cyber security, allowing that deal to close without mitigating that vulnerability, we are less safe.   Our companies, and our information, could be left open for the taking.   It's not because the acquirer is a bad actor.   It's just because the acquirer doesn't have security sufficient to handle its new and potentially sensitive role within the United States. And we know there are those who will take advantage of deficient security practices. The threat of economic espionage is serious, and the threat of cyber economic espionage is mounting.   Some estimate that, every year, the U.S. loses more than $300 billion from theft of our intellectual property. That figure is about equivalent to the current annual level of U.S. exports to Asia. Losses of that magnitude cost the American economy untold numbers of jobs. They reduce the profit that American firms make from research and development, which in turn reduces the incentives and resources for innovation. And the activity undermines the trust between countries and companies that is necessary to do business in a globalized economy. This is a serious problem, and one that we are committed to fighting.   Just last month, the Department of Justice announced charges against five members of the Chinese military for computer hacking, economic espionage, and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals, and solar products industries.   We're going to keep using all tools in our toolkit to tackle this threat to our national security.   Because the threat is serious, and it's mounting.\", \"     What This Means to You So what does all of this mean to you?   How can you have an impact on the vulnerabilities potentially introduced in cross-border transactions? In facilitating those transactions, it's in your interest not to acquire or create potential national security problems.   This means assessing closely any relevant compliance regimes, as well as the protections in place--or needed--to address the threat of economic espionage. We need to remember that, while profits are the lifeblood of our corporations, cutting corners here, while possibly leading to short-term gains, can be catastrophic.   Doing so can provide a dangerous capability to an aggressor and also lead to legal action that results in significant financial penalties and even prison time. Cross-border transactions, in particular, require care to avoid introducing potentially catastrophic vulnerabilities.   Countries have differing types of security regimes.   For example, export control regimes vary widely in their rigor. Even if a company is accustomed to meeting the standards of its home country, it may not fully comply with the requirements of the American export control regime.   These are important issues to think through when engaging in cross-border deals.   You can help companies from stumbling into major problems down the road. Similarly, foreign companies may approach the insider threat very differently from how American companies tackle it.   So, when you're considering the risks associated with a transaction, consider vulnerabilities to insider threats that the foreign company might introduce.   The time of mergers is a time of great uncertainty for employees.   And, especially when companies must shed jobs as part of the merger process, disgruntled employees may be particularly keen to cash in on insider information to which they have access.   That's precisely the time when defenses against insider threats must be strongest, not weakened by the introduction of lower standards. Additionally, be aware that the host country laws under which a foreign company operates can make it difficult to address key threats, such as the threat of cyber espionage.   Information-sharing practices, lawful cyber defenses, and other important aspects of cyber security operate according to different legal regimes in different countries.   If foreign laws suddenly apply because of a transaction and impede taking appropriate steps to erect cyber defenses, that transaction has just introduced a serious, and potentially damaging, vulnerability.\", '     Cyber    As you\\'ve heard, export control violations and economic espionage are increasingly bound up with cyber threats and cyber security.   But these are far from the only threats--to companies and to national security--that, today, emerge from cyberspace.   We\\'re also concerned about attacks--attacks against the financial interests of companies, and attacks that could endanger the lives and safety of our citizens.   And the same vulnerabilities that have already been exploited to steal from us may leave us susceptible to such attacks.    Already, there have been devastating attacks against private companies.   You\\'ve all probably heard about the serious cyber attacks launched against the U.S. financial sector.   This same type of activity is happening abroad, too.   For example, in     2012, Saudi Arabia\\'s state oil company, Aramco, suffered an attack that destroyed 30,000 of its computers--nearly 75% of its workstations, a devastating loss for any company.    And vulnerabilities can lead to far more than just infrastructure or financial damage.   Two years ago, for example, al Qaeda released a six-minute video instructing its followers that America\\'s present vulnerability to cyber attacks is comparable to the vulnerability of its airline security before September 11.   The video called on individuals \"with expertise in this domain to target the websites and information systems of big companies and government agencies.\" Cyber vulnerabilities--wherever they come from--could be a matter of life and death. You can help ensure that new cyber vulnerabilities never find their way into American businesses in the first instance. You can help ensure that those intent on breaking in do not receive new avenues to accomplish their theft.   And you can help ensure that innocent companies don\\'t inadvertently facilitate activity that threatens our national security. Those who could exploit cyber vulnerabilities are by no means limited to nation states.   The potential threats include organized criminal syndicates, lone hackers, and even terrorists intent on attacking the United States. Companies cannot depend solely on their antivirus software to defend against attackers linked to deep state military budgets.   It\\'s not a fair fight.   We must work together. That is why we at NSD and others throughout the U.S. Government have made cooperation with the private sector a key component of our cyber security strategy. On a daily basis, the FBI works with companies that have been the victims of hacks, many of which may not even know they\\'ve been victimized or how to protect themselves. In driving this work forward, the FBI has long relied on its InfraGard program, which brings together individuals in law enforcement, government, the private sector, and academia to talk about how to protect our critical infrastructure.   InfraGard has more than 25,000 active members. And the Justice Department recently teamed up with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a policy statement making it clear that antitrust law is not and should not be a bar to legitimate cyber security information sharing.    Furthermore, we issued a white paper, which clarifies that the Stored Communications Act doesn\\'t ordinarily restrict network operators from sharing certain data with the Government to help promote cyber security.   Additionally, we\\'re working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to discuss companies\\' concerns regarding disclosures of cyber breaches to investors and to formulate a workable solution. At NSD, we established the National Security Cyber Specialists\\' Network, which includes representatives from every U.S. Attorney\\'s Office around the country.   These prosecutors work closely with experts from our Division and the Criminal Division\\'s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section. They are specially trained, and focused on combating cyber threats to the national security, including those posed by nation states.   They also meet regularly with companies and their legal counsel to prevent attacks.   NSD attorneys have met with companies from coast to coast. And beyond DOJ, there are many efforts underway across the Government more broadly to work with private corporations on strengthening public-private cyber cooperation.   The Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and other departments and agencies work closely with companies to protect critical infrastructure. In short, as you work with clients and examine the potential implications of cross-border transactions, keep cyber security firmly in mind.   Cyber security is becoming an increasing part of how companies are valued for mergers and acquisitions, among other things.   And it\\'s also important, when assessing cyber risk, to evaluate whether the laws of another country might prevent your company from taking the steps necessary to keep your systems safe. All of this means that we in Government can help not just to keep your clients safe but also to make your clients worth more.   We are, in short, eager to work with you to prepare for and address these escalating national security threats.', '    ', \"     Conclusion We recognize that the legal regimes that can affect cross-border transactions--including CFIUS, export controls, and economic espionage--are significant and complex. But they are there to protect against the many threats we face. NSD will continue to approach this interconnected cluster of issues with a broad and varied toolkit.   We work with private companies to prevent economic espionage, including through cyber penetrations and exfiltrations.   We prosecute those who violate our nation's export control laws.   And we coordinate with our colleagues throughout the Federal Government, led by the Treasury Department, through the interagency review known as CFIUS. We hope you will take a similarly broad approach.   With the careful calibration of these tools and with an eye toward mitigating vulnerabilities and defending against threats, we protect the nation's security while promoting foreign investment, economic growth, and job creation. Thank you for letting me join you here this morning, and for your interest in these issues.\"]\n"

I'm grateful to be here at Brookings today discussing emerging national security threats.\", \"\\nOn Monday, the Department of Justice announced charges against five members of the Chinese military for computer hacking, economic espionage, and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals, and solar products industries.\\nToday, I'll focus on this growing threat: state-sponsored cyber intrusions targeting, for profit, sensitive and proprietary information of U.S. companies.\\nThese charges against uniformed members of the Chinese military were the first of their kind. Some said they could not be brought.\\nAt the Department, we follow the facts and evidence where they lead. Sometimes, the facts and evidence lead us to a lone hacker in a basement in the U.S., or an organized crime syndicate in Russia.\\nAnd sometimes, they lead us to a uniformed member of the Chinese military. But, no matter where they lead, there can be no free passes.\\nWe should not stand idly by, tacitly giving permission to  anyone to steal from us. We will hold accountable those who steal - no matter who they are, where they are, or whether they steal in person or through the Internet. Because cybercrime has real victims.\\nWhile cases like the one brought in Pittsburgh are extremely challenging, this week we proved that they are possible. The criminal justice system must be a critical component of our nation's cybersecurity strategy. As long as criminals continue stealing from American businesses, we will continue pursuing those criminals.\\nThe charges announced on Monday were groundbreaking. They represent a significant step forward in our cyber approach.\\nAnd they were many years in the making.\", 'The National Security Division\\nWithin the Justice Department, the National Security Division - or NSD - focuses on cyber threats to the national security - those posed by terrorists and nation states.\\nOur approach to these threats is deeply rooted in our Division\\'s history, and our success in the cyber arena builds upon a solid foundation.\\nNSD was created in response to the grave threat of terrorism. After the devastating attacks of September 11, it became clear that the Justice Department needed to reorganize to tackle terrorism and national security threats more effectively.\\nWe needed a single Division to integrate the work of prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the Intelligence Community.\\nSo, in 2006, Congress created the Department\\'s first new litigating division in almost half a century: NSD.\\nNSD works closely with partners throughout the government to ensure we leverage all available tools to combat the terrorism threat. And we\\'ve proven, in that context, that the criminal justice system is a vital part of our nation\\'s counterterrorism strategy.\\nJust this week, Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted by a jury in New York on eleven counts. He was involved in an attack in Yemen in December 1998 that resulted in the deaths of four hostages and provided material support to terrorists, including al Qaeda and the Taliban.\\nIn March, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans and other terrorism charges. Abu Ghaith was the son-in-law of Usama bin Laden and a senior member of al Qaeda. He was the face and voice of al Qaeda in the days and weeks after the 9/11 attacks.\\nIn both of these cases, it took more than a decade, but as a result of our integrated approach to combating terrorism, these men were brought to justice. These cases are the two most recent in a long line of successful terrorism prosecutions.\\nRecently, we took the lessons we learned from counterterrorism and applied them to our work on national security cyber threats. In the face of escalating threats, we recognized the need to reorganize. To integrate.\\nWhen I was chief of staff for Director Bob Mueller, the FBI undertook a transformation to meet the growing cyber threat. In 2011, NSD did the same.\\nIn late fall of 2011, ten years after 9/11, we established a review group to evaluate NSD\\'s existing work on national security threats and chart out a plan for the future. Six months later, that team issued recommendations that shaped what NSD\\'s national security cyber program looks like today.\\nMost significantly, in 2012, we created and trained the National Security Cyber Specialists\\' Network to focus on combating cyber threats to the national security. This Network - known as NSCS - includes prosecutors from every U.S. Attorney\\'s Office around the country, along with experts from the Department\\'s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and attorneys from across all parts of NSD.\\nAdopting the successful counterterrorism model, we now have prosecutors nationwide routinely meeting with the FBI to review intelligence and investigative files.\\nThe creation of the NSCS Network was motivated by a desire to make a tangible impact on U.S. cybersecurity efforts through criminal investigation and prosecution. By December 2012, we made public predictions that with the establishment of the NSCS - by empowering more than a hundred prosecutors in the field working with the FBI on these cases - one would be brought.The Pittsburgh Case \\nAnd this week, we made good on that promise. It is this new, integrated approach that made the Pittsburgh case possible. As part of the creation of the NSCS, we brought prosecutors from around the country - Wisconsin, New York, and Georgia - to help NSD build this case.\\nWe partnered with the Western District of Pennsylvania, where victims were repeatedly hit. And we worked with offices across the FBI - from California, to Oregon, to Oklahoma, and back here in D.C.\\nOur team thought creatively. They worked collaboratively. They explored all available options for stopping this activity.\\nThat\\'s how we were able to indict five members of the Third Department of the People\\'s Liberation Army, or \"3PLA,\" and its \"Unit 61398.\" These men stand accused of cyber intrusions targeting a range of U.S. industries.\\nThe indictment alleges, with particularity, specific actions on specific days by specific actors to use their computers to steal information from across our economy.\\nIt alleges that while the men and women of our American businesses spent their business days innovating, creating, and developing strategies to compete in the global marketplace, these members of Unit 61398 spent their business days in Shanghai stealing the fruits of Americans\\' labor.\\nIt alleges that they stole information particularly beneficial to Chinese companies, and took communications that would provide competitors with key insight into the strategy and vulnerabilities of the victims.', 'Answering Critics\\nNow, some question this law enforcement action. Generally speaking, these questions fall into three categories:', 'First , whether there is a clear line between what these individuals have been accused of, and what the U.S. or other nations do;', 'Second, whether charges like these can truly impact cybersecurity, particularly when there may be significant challenges to arresting and ultimately trying these individuals in criminal court;', 'And third, whether the government should instead focus on hardening defenses rather than pursuing charges.', 'Stealing Is Stealing \\nAs to the first question: while some commentators may ask whether this is a new line to draw, in fact we are aware of no nation that publicly states that theft of information for commercial gain is acceptable.\\nEven in this case, China has not attempted to justify the allegations. Instead, they deny them.\\nAnd this has been a consistent response. A little over a year ago, the Chinese Government flatly denied reports that Unit 61398 was hacking U.S. companies. A spokesman for China\\'s Ministry of National Defense said, \"Chinese military forces have never supported any hacking activities.\"\\nChina also challenged the United States to present \"hard evidence, evidence that could stand up in court,\" that cyber attacks against American targets are connected to the Chinese military. Well, we did.\\nThe response? Hours after Monday\\'s announcement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called the accusations \"purely fictitious, extremely absurd.\"\\nNow, we are confident that we have the evidence to back up these accusations in a court of law. Read the indictment. For the first time, we have exposed the real faces and names behind the keyboards in Shanghai used to steal from American businesses.\\nThis is not conduct that responsible nations within the global economic community should tolerate.\\nIn the United States, we believe that individuals and companies are entitled to the results of our creativity, including our property--and intellectual property. And we believe their work should not simply be taken from them and given to others.\\nThis is not a uniquely American value. Individuals around the world believe that people shouldn\\'t take what others make.\\nResponsible nations do conduct intelligence activities. And nations openly acknowledge that they have intelligence services. Like others, our intelligence activities are focused on the national security needs of our country.\\nThat is why the President, earlier this year, reaffirmed in PPD-28 that \"[i]t is not an authorized foreign intelligence . . . purpose to collect such information to afford a competitive advantage to U.S. companies and U.S. business sectors commercially.\"\\nU.S. foreign intelligence collection occurs under the framework of the rule of law, involving oversight by all three branches of Government. As the Church Committee Report recognized back in 1976, \"the Constitution provides for a system of checks and balances and interdependent power as between the Congress and the executive branch with respect to foreign intelligence activity.\"\\nThe very protections built into that legal framework subject that information to rigorous oversight, and prevent sharing it with private companies for their private gain.\\nBut let\\'s be clear: those same protections do not exist in certain other countries that are targeting, every day, American trade secrets, sensitive business information, and intellectual property in order to steal specific information and pass it along to their domestic companies in order to give them a competitive edge. To pretend otherwise is to promote a narrative of false equivalency.\\nEven though we know of no nation that stands up publicly to defend corporate theft for the profit of state-owned enterprises, in the shadows, some appear to encourage and support it.\\nIn short, we allege the members of Unit 61398 committed theft, pure and simple.\\nSo although this case is the first of a kind, it is also, in some respects, just business as usual. As they have for decades, prosecutors in the field and at CCIPS use criminal investigation and prosecution to disrupt cyber crime. CCIPS is one of our most important partners in the fight against cyber threats.\\nLaw enforcement has long been used to combat cyber threats and, as recently as this week, has made a tremendous impact on our nation\\'s cybersecurity.\\nAs you have likely seen, on Monday, the Department of Justice announced charges in connection with Blackshades malicious software. These charges were part of the largest-ever global cyber law enforcement operation, involving more than 90 arrests and other law enforcement actions in 19 countries.\\nLikewise, in the national security arena, when criminal law enforcement is the most effective tool we have to disrupt a terrorist threat, we employ it no matter how far away or shielded from prosecution the defendants may seem today.\\nWhen criminal enterprises steal our intellectual property and personal information, or threaten our security, we investigate and prosecute them.\\nThese are not the first charges that we have lodged against individuals who steal from Americans to benefit state-owned enterprises.\\nAs just one example, in March, we successfully obtained a significant conviction for economic espionage.\\nWalter Liew, an electrical engineer, obtained one of DuPont\\'s secrets - a process, honed over many decades, for making a multi-purpose white pigment - and passed it to a large Chinese state-owned company.\\nWhat Liew stole was something Americans see and use daily. Something that does not have a national security implication. Something that simply brings a profit.\\nLiew stole the formula for the color white. He was brought to justice in the U.S. criminal justice system.\\nLike Liew, we allege that the members of Unit 61398 stole to benefit Chinese state-owned enterprises. The thefts are similar. They both took place here. The difference is that Unit 61398 operated remotely, from the previously safe spaces in Shanghai.\\nWe will no longer permit safe havens. Individuals cannot avoid the consequences of their actions simply by capitalizing on 21st century tools and operating from the comfort of their desks half a world away.', 'Meeting the Threat of Cyber Economic Espionage\\nThese crimes are the same as many crimes that we have investigated and prosecuted before. Only the method or means is different.\\nBut the threat we face is increasingly moving out of the physical world and into cyberspace, and thus, prosecutions of those who steal from us remotely must and will become the new normal. We will continue to pursue this option, along with others available to us.\\nThe threat of economic espionage is serious, and the threat of  cyber economic espionage is mounting. Some estimate that, every year, the U.S. loses more than $300 billion from theft of our intellectual property. That figure is about equivalent to the current annual level of U.S. exports to Asia.\\nLosses of that magnitude cost the American economy untold numbers of jobs. They reduce the profit that American firms make from research and development, which in turn reduces the incentives and resources for innovation. As U.S. Attorney David Hickton said on Monday, \"When these cyber-intrusions occur, production slows, plants close, workers get laid off and lose their homes.\"\\nSuch activity also undermines the trust between countries and companies that is necessary to do business in a globalized economy.\\nAnd our companies cannot face it alone. Companies cannot depend solely on their antivirus software to defend against attackers linked to deep state military budgets. It\\'s not a fair fight.\\nTo defend against those empowered by a government, we need our government on our side. We must support our entrepreneurs by using every tool we have, to prevent, deter, and disrupt this conduct in any way we can.\\nAnd likewise, we need you. Just as the local police can\\'t control crime without victims calling in those crimes, our law enforcement officials, too, need cooperation from victims. It\\'s our hope that the more cases we bring and the more perpetrators we bring to justice, the higher the level of cooperation we\\'re likely to receive.\\nWe cannot let this conduct go undeterred. Doing so would threaten our nation\\'s security.', 'Deterring Cyber-Enabled Economic Espionage \\nCases like the Pittsburgh case will have a deterrent effect.\\nTo those critics who raise questions about whether these charges will have any impact in light of the challenges associated with arresting and trying these individuals - the deterrent effect of charges can be significant.\\nGeneral Keith Alexander, former NSA Director, explained that \"the only way to deter cyber attack is to work to catch perpetrators and take strong and public action when we do.\"\\nFBI Director Mueller called for figuring out who is targeting us and going after them, saying: \"We must remember that behind every intrusion is a person responsible for that intrusion--a warm body behind the keyboard, whether he or she sits in Tehran or Tucson; Shanghai or Seattle; Bucharest or the Bronx. Our ultimate goal must be to identify and deter the persons behind the keyboards.\" The government and private sector alike are increasing the call for prosecuting cyber theft of trade secrets.\\nWe need to prevent attacks. And deterrence helps. Prosecutions can simultaneously punish those who have already committed bad acts and deter those who might otherwise commit bad acts in the future. In other words, by going after these crimes, we can help to stop the next group of criminals.\\nIt is, of course, possible that we will never obtain custody. But even if these five defendants evade arrest, laying bare this criminal activity takes it out of the shadows.', 'Law Enforcement: One Piece of the Puzzle\\nLaw enforcement investigations can also support other valuable tools. Criminal charges can justify economic sanctions from our colleagues in the Treasury Department, sanctions that prevent criminals from engaging in financial transactions with U.S. entities and deny access to the U.S. financial system.\\nThey can facilitate diplomacy by the State Department, as our nation\\'s diplomats lay out evidence of state-sponsored cyber theft to foreign government officials and force them to answer for those actions, or coordinate with other victimized countries. Furthermore, the investigations themselves can lead other governments to take action, even when the United States doesn\\'t end up doing so.\\nSo, we will continue to bring these kinds of cases. However, it is not easy. Prosecutions like this present unique challenges.\\nCases can take years to investigate, and it can sometimes be tough to attribute the unlawful activity to particular individuals.\\nThey involve difficult decisions regarding how to protect sensitive sources and methods. And even after charging, it can be challenging to obtain custody of the defendants and bring them to justice.\\nBut difficult does not mean impossible, and the status quo simply will not do. As the Attorney General said earlier this week in announcing these charges, \"enough is enough.\"\\nWe would not stand idly by as people hauled away our wealth in trucks. Likewise, we cannot allow it to be sucked out through the Internet.\\nThe indictment I\\'ve been discussing is an important first step. But it must be just that - the first. Prosecutions will not do it alone.\\nWe need to build on this success and keep responding--with prosecutions where possible and with all of the other tools in our toolkit.\\nWe need to keep at it, and we appreciate the bipartisan support we\\'ve received from Congress, including particularly supportive words from Senators King and Whitehouse as well as from the House Intelligence and Homeland Security Committees.\\nMany of these individuals provided resources and encouragement as we undertook transformation. We must continue until our adversaries realize that the costs of stealing from our companies outweigh the benefits.', \"Cyber Defense - Empowering victims\\nSo far, we talked primarily about criminal prosecution and other tools. But we recognize that stopping attacks before they ever take place is the ultimate goal. We will have succeeded when there are no more criminal charges to bring.\\nTo that end, we also worked hard to improve cyber defenses, both in Government and with the private sector.\\nThe FBI works closely with companies that have been the victims of hackers through, among other things, its InfraGard program. That program, which has more than 25,000 active members, brings together individuals in law enforcement, government, the private sector, and academia to talk about how to protect our critical infrastructure.\\nLikewise, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and other departments and agencies routinely work closely with companies to protect critical infrastructure.\\nThe Department heard from you and is taking steps to respond to the concerns of the private sector. Just last month, we teamed up with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a policy statement making it clear that antitrust law is not and should not be a bar to legitimate cyber security information sharing.\\nAnd earlier this month, the Justice Department offered a white paper clarifying that the Stored Communications Act doesn't ordinarily restrict network operators from sharing certain data with the Government to guard information. This guidance will help the private sector collaborate more freely to protect itself. All of this is just a start. Going forward, we need legislation to facilitate greater information sharing between the private sector and the government.\", 'Educating the Public\\nThe charges announced earlier this week benefit not only victims but also the broader American people, and others worldwide.\\nChief Justice Burger once noted that criminal prosecutions, as a general matter, have an \"educative effect\" on the public.\\nWhile we may appreciate, on a theoretical level, that hacking to steal corporate secrets poses a major national security threat, there\\'s no substitute for the educative effect that an indictment has.\\nPutting a face at the keyboard, and quantifying the damage done, may help to galvanize all of us to improve our cyber security. It may also make us more vigilant to the economic, military, and geopolitical dangers associated with cyber space. For example, it might lead companies and other entities to examine their connection logs a little bit more closely to see what activities those reveal, and from where.', \"Conclusion\\nTo wrap up, I want to applaud the dedicated investigators and prosecutors whose hard work produced this week's important indictment. It's only a first step but it's a big step, and it's part of our growing effort to hold accountable those who steal American innovation.\\nAt the same time, we must acknowledge that prosecution alone is, ultimately, just one tool in the broader toolset for addressing the cyber threat. Prosecutions alone will not solve the problem.\\nTrust in government depends, in part, on our ability to defend, protect, and obtain justice for our citizens. Indictments and prosecutions are one clear and powerful way in which we the people, governed by the rule of law, legitimize and prove our allegations.\\nAnd those actions have real consequences for the criminals they target, and deter those who might otherwise become criminals in the future.\\nWe continue to protect Americans from being victimized through cyberspace, and we need your support.\\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to questions.\"]\n",

      "['\\nA federal jury in San Francisco has found two individuals and one company guilty of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, bankruptcy fraud, tax evasion, and obstruction of justice for their roles in a long-running effort to obtain U.S. trade secrets for the benefit of companies controlled by the government of the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC), announced U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag; John P. Carlin, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice; David Johnson, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), San Francisco Division; and Jose Martinez, Special Agent in Charge of the Oakland Field Office, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Criminal Investigation.\\nThe jury found that Walter Lian-Heen Liew (aka Liu Yuanxuan), his company, USA Performance Technology Inc. (USAPTI), and Robert Maegerle conspired to steal trade secrets from E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company regarding their chloride-route titanium dioxide production technology and sold those secrets for large sums of money to state-owned companies of the PRC. The purpose of their conspiracy was to help those companies develop large-scale chloride-route titanium dioxide production capability in the PRC, including a planned 100,000-ton titanium dioxide factory in Chongqing.  This case marks the first federal jury conviction on charges brought under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.\\n\"Fighting economic espionage and trade secret theft is one of the top priorities of this Office and we will aggressively pursue anyone, anywhere who attempts to steal valuable information from the United States,\" said U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag.  \"As today\\'s verdict demonstrates, foreign governments threaten our economic and national security by engaging in aggressive and determined efforts to steal U.S. intellectual property.  I commend the efforts of the women and men of the FBI and the IRS in protecting America\\'s businesses and our national security.\"\\n\"The theft of America\\'s trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign government poses a substantial threat to our economic and national security\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Carlin. \"Today\\'s verdict clearly demonstrates that we take this threat seriously. This case shows that we will not hesitate to pursue and prosecute those who steal from American businesses.\"\\n\"The battle against economic espionage has become one of the FBI\\'s main fronts in its efforts to protect U.S. national security in the 21st century,\" said Special Agent in Charge David Johnson.\\n\"This is a case about lying, cheating, and stealing,\" said Jose M. Martinez, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation. \"The defendants stole secrets, lied to the bankruptcy court and cheated the IRS and creditors.  In today\\'s economic environment, it\\'s more important than ever that the American people feel confident that everyone is playing by the rules and paying their fair share.\"\\nThe jury also found that Liew, USAPTI, and Maegerle obstructed justice during the course of their conspiracy. The jury found that Liew filed false tax returns for USAPTI and Performance Group, a predecessor company to USAPTI, and made false statements and oaths in bankruptcy proceedings for Performance Group. The guilty verdicts followed a seven-week jury trial before the Honorable Jeffery S. White, U.S. District Court Judge.\\nLiew, 56, of Walnut Creek, Calif., was convicted of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, attempted economic espionage, attempted theft of trade secrets, possession of trade secrets, conveying trade secrets, conspiracy to obstruct justice, witness tampering, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, false statements, filing false tax returns, false statements in bankruptcy proceedings, and false oath in bankruptcy proceedings. Liew was an owner and president of USAPTI, a company headquartered in Oakland, Calif., that offered consulting services.  USAPTI was found guilty of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, attempted economic espionage, attempted theft of trade secrets, possession of trade secrets, conveying trade secrets, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\\nEvidence at trial showed that in the 1990s, Liew met with the government of the PRC and was informed that the PRC had prioritized the development of chloride-route titanium dioxide (TiO2) technology.  TiO2 is a commercially valuable white pigment with numerous uses, including coloring paint, plastics, and paper.  DuPont\\'s TiO2 chloride-route process also produces titanium tetrachloride, a material with military and aerospace uses.  Liew was aware that DuPont had developed industry leading TiO2 technology over many years of research and development and assembled a team of former DuPont employees, including Robert Maegerle, to assist him in his efforts to convey DuPont\\'s TiO2 technology to entities in the PRC.  Liew executed contracts with state-owned entities of the PRC for chloride-route TiO2 projects that relied on the transfer of illegally obtained DuPont technology. Liew, Maegerle, and USAPTI obtained and sold DuPont\\'s TiO2 trade secret to the Pangang Group companies for more than $20 million.\\nRobert Maegerle, 78, of Harbeson, Del., was found guilty of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, attempted theft of trade secrets, conveying trade secrets, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Evidence at trial showed that Maegerle was employed by DuPont as an engineer from 1956 to 1991 where he had developed detailed knowledge of DuPont\\'s TiO2 technology and expertise in building TiO2 production lines. He also had access to DuPont TiO2 trade secrets, including specific information regarding DuPont\\'s TiO2 facility at Kuan Yin, Taiwan. He provided these trade secrets to Liew and USAPTI in furtherance of their contracts with state-owned companies of the PRC for chloride-route TiO2 projects.\\nThe jury also found Liew, Maegerle, and USAPTI guilty of obstructing justice by causing an answer to be filed in a federal civil lawsuit in which they falsely claimed that no information from DuPont\\'s Kuan Yin plant was used in the USAPTI designs for the development of TiO2 manufacturing facilities.  Liew was also found guilty of witness tampering for his efforts to influence a co-defendant\\'s testimony in the civil lawsuit. The jury also convicted Liew of conspiring with his wife, Christina Liew, to mislead the FBI by corruptly concealing records, documents, and other objects during the FBI\\'s investigation into their criminal activity.\\nLiew was also convicted of filing a false income tax return for his company, Performance Group, for calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008 and for USAPTI in 2009 and 2010. The jury also found Liew guilty of making false statements and a false oath in connection with filing for bankruptcy for Performance Group in 2009.\\nLiew, as co-owner of USAPTI, entered into contracts worth in excess of $20 million to convey TiO2 trade secret technology to Pangang Group companies. The Liews received millions of dollars of proceeds from these contracts. The proceeds were wired through the United States, Singapore, and ultimately back into several bank accounts in the PRC in the names of relatives of Christina Liew.\\nDuPont is a company based in Wilmington, Del., that manufactures a wide variety of products, including TiO2. DuPont invented the chloride-route process for manufacturing TiO2 in the late-1940s and since then has invested heavily in research and development to improve that production process. The global titanium dioxide market has been valued at roughly $12 billion per year, and DuPont has the largest share of that market.\\nThe chloride-route process is cleaner, more efficient, and produces a higher-quality product than the sulfate-route process prevalent in the PRC. The object of the defendants\\' conspiracy was to convey DuPont\\'s secret chloride-route technology to the PRC companies for the purpose of building modern TiO2 production facilities in the PRC without investing in time-consuming, costly research and development.\\nThe second superseding indictment also charges, Liew\\'s wife, Christina Hong Qiao Liew (aka Qiao Hong), with conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, attempted theft of trade secrets, possession of trade secrets, witness tampering, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, and false statements. The charges against Ms. Liew were severed from those against Walter Liew, Maegerle, and USAPTI. Ms. Liew will appear before the Honorable Jeffery S. White on Thursday, March 6, 2014, in San Francisco to set the date for her trial.\\nTze Chao (aka Zhao Zhi), a former DuPont employee who was also charged in the second superseding indictment, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit economic espionage on March 1, 2012.\\nHou Shengdong, the Vice Director of the Chloride Process TiO2 Project Department for the Pangang Group, was also charged in the second superseding indictment with conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, and attempted economic espionage.  He is currently a fugitive.\\nCharges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, and attempted economic espionage are also pending against the four PRC state-owned companies charged in the second superseding indictment.\\nThe sentencing hearings for Liew, Maegerle, and USAPTI are scheduled for June 10, 2014, before Judge White in Oakland, Calif. Liew was remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals pending sentencing. Maegerle remains out of custody on conditions of release.  The maximum statutory penalties for each of the counts are listed below.

      "[\"  Good afternoon, Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, and Members of the Committee.  Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today to discuss the Department of Justice's fight against cybercrime.  I also particularly want to thank the Chair for holding this hearing and for his continued leadership on these important issues.\", '  At the Department of Justice, we are devoting significant resources and energy to fighting computer hacking and other types of cybercrime. The recent revelations about the massive thefts of financial information from large retail stores have served as a stark reminder to all of us about how vulnerable we are to cyber criminals who are determined to steal our personal information. The Justice Department is more committed than ever to ensuring that the full range of government enforcement tools is brought to bear in the fight against cybercrime.', \"  Cybercrime has increased dramatically over the last decade, and our financial infrastructure has suffered repeated cyber intrusions. As we all know, it is becoming far too commonplace an occurrence that our email accounts are hijacked, our financial information siphoned away, and our personal information compromised.  The technology revolution - which has brought enormous benefits to individuals, U.S. companies and our economy as a whole - has also facilitated these criminal activities, making available a wide array of new methods that identity thieves can use to access and exploit the personal information of others.  Skilled criminal hackers are now able to perpetrate large-scale data breaches that leave, in some cases, tens of millions of individuals at risk of identity theft.  Today's criminals, who often sit on the other side of the world, can hack into computer systems of universities, merchants, financial institutions, credit card processing companies, and data processors to steal large volumes of sensitive and valuable information.  They then peddle the stolen information to other criminals, use the information for their own financial gain, or sometimes even terrorize and extort their victims.\", '  Last December, Target, the second-largest U.S. discount chain, announced that credit and debit card data for as many as 40 million consumers who shopped in its stores between November 27 and December 15 may have been compromised.  Target then disclosed on January 10 that thieves had also accessed the personal information, including names, phone numbers, home addresses, and/or email addresses, of as many as 70 million people - information that is valued by criminals because it can be used to lure victims with fake emails or hack into other accounts. The U.S. Secret Service, within the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice are investigating this massive data breach.', \"  A few days later, retailer Neiman Marcus Inc. reported that it also was the victim of a suspected cyberattack over the holidays in which some of its customers' credit card information may have been stolen.  Target and Neiman Marcus are just two of the latest known victims.\", \"  The Justice Department is vigorously responding to hacking and other cybercrimes through the tenacious work of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, also known as CCIPS, which partners with Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Coordinators in U.S. Attorney's Offices across the country as part of a network of almost 300 Justice Department cybercrime prosecutors.  In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has made combating cyber threats one of its top national priorities, working through Cyber Task Forces in each of its 56 field offices and continuing to strengthen the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.  Every day, these prosecutors and agents strive to hold to account cyber criminals who victimize Americans.\", '  Consider, for instance, the case of Vladislav Horohorin, which was prosecuted here in the District of Columbia by CCIPS and the United States Attorney\\'s Office, based on an investigation by the FBI and U.S. Secret Service.  Horohorin, known by the online nickname \"BadB,\" used online criminal forums to sell stolen credit and debit card information to individuals around the world to enable fraudulent transactions by other cyber criminals.  At the time of his arrest, he possessed more than 2.5 million stolen credit and debit card numbers.  In one instance, he participated in a criminal group that, in a single 12-hour crime spree, stole over $9.4 million through fraudulent transactions at over 2,100 ATMs in 280 cities around the world. As a result of a massive investigation spanning several years - and several countries - we located and charged him, and he was arrested after leaving Russia for France.  In April 2013, Horohorin was sentenced to serve 88 months in prison.', '  Our investigation of the Coreflood botnet is another example of our commitment to stopping massive computer crimes by using the most innovative law enforcement techniques. A botnet is a network of secretly hacked computers, sometimes numbering in the millions, which are located in homes, schools, and offices.  The computers are infected with sophisticated malicious software, or \"malware,\" and once the malware is installed, hackers can put these bots to countless illegal uses. The Coreflood botnet, for example, hijacked hundreds of thousands of computers for the purpose of stealing private personal and financial information - including usernames and passwords - from unsuspecting computer users.  In one example, the Coreflood botnet software illegally monitored Internet communications between a computer user and her bank, took over an online banking session, and then emptied the user\\'s bank account.  Overall losses from the scheme were staggering, estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars.', '  Although the individuals controlling the Coreflood network resided overseas and were largely outside the direct reach of U.S. law enforcement, in 2011, CCIPS, the United States Attorney\\'s Office for the District of Connecticut, and the FBI used a combination of civil and criminal legal authorities to seize key control servers, shut down the network, and work with private sector partners to help disinfect victims\\' computer systems. Among other things, as part of this ground-breaking law enforcement operation, the Justice Department obtained a court order authorizing the government to respond to signals sent from infected computers in the United States to stop the Coreflood software from running, and thus to prevent further harm to hundreds of thousands of Americans whose computers were under the control of the botnet. And, in a relatively short period of time, the Coreflood botnet was dismantled. The Department has continued to place a high priority on arresting and deterring those who create botnets.  CCIPS and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in Atlanta just last week announced the guilty plea of a Russian citizen named Aleksandr Panin for developing and distributing malware called \"SpyEye.\" The SpyEye malware created botnets that stole personal and financial information such as credit card information, banking credentials, usernames, passwords, and personal identification numbers.  Panin sold his software to at least 154 criminal \"clients,\" who in turn used it to infect an estimated 1.4 million computers around the world. The FBI arrested Panin on July 1, 2013, while he was flying through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.', '  Hacking can have terrifying consequences even when conducted on a smaller scale, and we have vigorously pursued hackers who have used the Internet to invade Americans\\' privacy. In 2011, for example, in a case investigated by the FBI, the United States Attorney\\'s Office in Los Angeles successfully prosecuted a hacker named Luis Mijangos.  Mijangos hacked for sexual thrill.  He infected the computers of victims with malicious software that gave him complete control over their computers.  He deliberately targeted teens and young women, reading their emails, turning on their computer microphones and listening to conversations taking place in their homes, and, most importantly for him, watching them through their webcams as they undressed.  Even more frightening, Mijangos then extorted certain victims by threatening to post intimate pictures on the Internet unless the victims provided him with even more salacious images or videos of themselves.  When one victim shared Mijangos\\'s threats with a friend, Mijangos retaliated by posting nude pictures of the victim on her friend\\'s social networking page.  In another instance, Mijangos had infected the computers of a college student, her boyfriend, and her roommate. When the victim called her boyfriend, and they discussed calling the police, Mijangos reportedly sent the boyfriend an anonymous instant message that said: \"I know you\\'re talking to each other right now!\"  The victim then decided to call the police. But when she did, she got a message, too.  \"I know you just called the police,\" he wrote.  His message was unmistakable: he was in control; he knew everything; and he had the power to hurt the victim further if she reported the crime.  At the time of his arrest, FBI computer forensics experts had determined that Mijangos had infected more than 100 computers that were used by approximately 230 individuals, at least 44 of them minors. The Court sentenced Mijangos to 72 months in federal prison. There are many other examples of the Department\\'s recent work to bring cyber criminals to justice.  There is the takedown of Silk Road, a hidden website designed to enable its users to buy and sell illegal drugs and other unlawful goods and services, and charges against the alleged operator of the site by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Offices for the Southern District of New York and the District of Maryland.  There is the prosecution by CCIPS and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in New Hampshire of Adrian-Tiberiu Oprea, a Romanian who recently received a 15-year sentence in September for leading an international, multimillion-dollar scheme to remotely hack into and steal unsuspecting customers\\' payment card data from U.S. merchants\\' computers. The case was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service. There is the recent indictment by CCIPS and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the Western District of Wisconsin of Sinovel Wind Group Co. Ltd., a China-based manufacturer and exporter of wind turbines, which is alleged to have stolen trade secrets from an American company for the purpose of producing wind turbines and retrofitting existing wind turbines with the stolen technology.  And on January 23, the FBI arrested two men for conspiring to hack into victims\\' email accounts to steal nude photos that were later posted on the \"revenge porn\" website  isan yon eup.com  . The U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the Central District of California charged the men with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.', '  The recent disclosures about the massive data breaches at retailers have underscored that cybercrime is a real, present threat, and one that is growing.  Cyber criminals steal the personal and financial information of individuals, carry out Distributed Denial of Service (or DDOS)1 attacks on networks, and purloin sensitive corporate or military data. These criminals can easily prey on victims halfway around the world. They sometimes use virtual currencies to enrich themselves while hiding their identities and avoiding leaving their fingerprints in the traditional banking system.  Despite these challenges, the Justice Department is staying ahead of these threats. We are using all of the tools available to us to identify cyber criminals, wherever in the world they are located, break up their networks, and bring them to justice. We are developing meaningful partnerships with foreign law enforcement to strengthen our collective capacity to fight cybercrime. And we use our tools responsibly and consistent with established legal safeguards that protect against abuse.  But without the tools we have been provided, we would not be able to bring offenders to justice. And we must ensure that the statutes we enforce keep up with technology so that we can keep pace with the cyber criminals, who are constantly developing new tactics and methods.', '  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act', '  In addition to the important law enforcement techniques that we must use to successfully investigate cyber criminals, our prosecutors also rely on substantive criminal statutes to bring cyber criminals to justice.  One of the most important of these laws is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, also called the \"CFAA.\" The CFAA is the primary Federal law against hacking.  It protects the public against criminals who hack into computers to steal information, install malicious software, and delete files. The CFAA, in short, reflects our baseline expectation that people are entitled to have control over their own computers and are entitled to trust that information they store in their computers remains safe.', \"  The CFAA was first enacted in 1986, at a time when the problem of cybercrime was still in its infancy.  Over the years, a series of measured, modest changes have been made to the CFAA to reflect new technologies and means of committing crimes and to equip law enforcement with tools to respond to changing threats.  The CFAA has not been amended since 2008, and the intervening years have again created the need for the enactment of modest, incremental changes.  The Administration's May 2011 legislative proposal proposed revisions to keep Federal criminal law up-to-date.  We continue to support changes like these that will keep up with rapidly-evolving technologies and uses.\", '  Deterring Insider Threats', '  Another portion of the CFAA that has received considerable attention is the way that the law addresses the threat posed by insiders - those who have some right to access a system but who abuse that right, such as employees of a business who unlawfully make off with their employers\\' intellectual property.  The CFAA addresses this problem by criminalizing conduct by those who \"exceed authorized access\" to a protected computer.', \"  Some commentators have contended that the CFAA's provision criminalizing exceeding authorized access should be limited or abolished because the provision is subject to misuse or overuse.  Some have worried, for example, that the statute permits prosecution of people who merely lie about their age when going to a dating site, or harmlessly violate the terms of service of an email provider.  To that end, we are open to addressing these concerns by working with Congress to develop appropriate statutory amendments, such as new statutory thresholds regarding the value or sensitivity of the information improperly accessed under 1030(a)(2), or new language making more explicit that the statute does not permit prosecution based on access restrictions that are not clearly understood.\", '  At the same time, insider hackers pose a serious threat to American businesses and citizens.  Examples of insiders include employees at a credit card company or stock broker who regularly deal with sensitive information.  There is generally no way to encrypt and password- protect every piece of data on a system to eliminate the insider threat, because employees need to be able access the data to do their jobs.  Thus, written policies between employers and employees - which are simply a contractual means of ensuring trust - are an important way to secure information.  Violating these written restrictions harms businesses.  Just as businesses justifiably rely on the criminal law to deter thefts of physical property, so they also should be able to rely on it to deter misappropriation of their private, sensitive data - data that is often far more valuable than equipment or supplies.', '  In recent years, two courts of appeals have interpreted the CFAA to bar certain \"insider\" cases, creating a circuit split.  Compare United States v. Nosal, 676 F.3d 854 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc) and WEC Carolina Energy Solutions LLC v. Miller, 687 F.3d 199 (4th Cir. 2012), with United States v. John, 597 F.3d 263 (5th Cir. 2010); United States v. Rodriguez, 628 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2010); and Int\\'l Airport Ctrs., LLC v. Citrin, 440 F.3d 418 (7th Cir. 2006). Specifically, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have interpreted the statute not to permit prosecution as long as an insider was authorized to access the database or information in question for any purpose.  Under this interpretation, the CFAA would not apply where a police officer accessed an arrest record for the purpose of harassing a romantic rival, because the officer was authorized to access the records to assist in criminal investigations.  Similarly, under this interpretation, the CFAA would not apply where a bank employee accessed customer records for the purpose of selling them to organized crime members, because the employee was authorized to access the records to resolve customer complaints. This interpretation makes it substantially more challenging for DOJ to protect American companies from the misappropriation of their intellectual property and sensitive data - misappropriation that may also directly harm American citizens when that data includes their personal or financial information. We look forward to working with Congress to address these important issues.', '  Data Breach Notification', '  While the Justice Department continues to use all of the tools at its disposal to combat cybercrime, the Administration recommends the establishment of a strong, uniform Federal standard requiring certain types of businesses to report data breaches and thefts of electronic personally identifiable information.  Businesses should be required to provide prompt notice to consumers in the wake of a breach.  We should balance the need to safeguard consumers and hold compromised entities accountable, while setting clear standards that avoid undue burdens on industry.  We should include a safe harbor for breaches with no reasonable risk of harm or fraud.  This approach would protect the privacy of individuals while holding firms accountable for failure to safeguard personal data.', '  In 2011, the Administration put forth a package of recommended cybersecurity amendments that included a data breach notification proposal.2   The 2011 proposal is based upon the belief that American consumers should know when they are at risk of identity theft or other harms because of a data security breach.  In addition, to strengthen the tools available to law enforcement to investigate data security breaches and to combat identity theft, the proposal would require that business entities notify the Federal government of a data security breach in a timely fashion so that law enforcement can promptly pursue the perpetrators of cyber intrusions and identity theft.  The proposal has several sections of particular note.', '  First, under this proposal, following the discovery of a security breach, business entities must notify any individual whose sensitive, personally identifiable information has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed or acquired, unless there is no reasonable risk of harm. Business entities covered under this requirement are those that use, access, transmit, store, dispose of, or collect sensitive, personally identifiable information about more than 10,000 people during any 12-month period.  But the Administration believes that business entities which have demonstrated that they have effective data breach prevention programs should be exempt from notice to individuals if a risk assessment concludes that there is no reasonable risk that a security breach has harmed, or will harm, the individuals whose information was compromised. The proposal would also recognize that such harm may be avoided where the stolen data has been rendered unusable by criminals; for example, through encryption, or through programs that block unauthorized financial transactions and provide effective notice to affected victims.  The proposal also includes certain exceptions for notice that would impair law enforcement investigations or national security.', \"  Because of the importance of bringing the perpetrators of data breaches to justice, the Administration's proposal would also require business entities to notify law enforcement agencies if the security breach involves (1) the sensitive information of more than 5,000 people; (2) a database or other data system containing sensitive information of more than 500,000 people nationwide; (3) databases owned by the Federal government; or (4) primarily the sensitive information of Federal employees and contractors involved in national security or law enforcement.  Businesses would report to a single entity that would then promptly disseminate the reported information to key Federal law enforcement agencies.  In recognition of the time- sensitivity of data breach investigations, the notice required under this section would be provided as promptly as possible, but no later than 72 hours before notification to an individual or 10 days after discovery of the events requiring notice, whichever comes first.\", \"  Millions of Americans every year are faced with the potential for fraud and identity theft from online breaches of their sensitive, personally identifiable information.  The nation clearly needs strong protections for consumers' rights and privacy, and accountability for businesses that do not safeguard credit card and social security numbers, names and addresses, medical records, and other sensitive information.  The Administration's proposal creates a strong national standard to notify consumers with clear, actionable information when their personal information is compromised.  Responsible entities will be held accountable through these disclosures.  At the same time, a consistent national standard and reasonable exemptions for harmless breaches will reduce unnecessary compliance costs.  This proposal meets the dual challenge of ensuring privacy, security, and safety without burdening economic prosperity and innovation.\", '  Access Device FraudTo ensure that we can take action when cyber criminals acting overseas steal data from U.S. financial institutions, we also recommend a modification to what is known as the access device fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. SS 1029.  One of the most common motivations for hacking crime is to obtain financial information.  The access device fraud statute proscribes the unlawful possession and use of \"access devices,\" such as credit card numbers and devices such as credit card embossing machines.  Not only do lone individuals commit this crime, but, more and more, organized criminal enterprises have formed to commit such intrusions and to exploit the stolen data through fraud.', '  The Department of Justice recommends that the statute be expanded to prosecute offenders in foreign countries who directly and significantly harm United States financial institutions and citizens. Currently, a criminal who trades in credit card information issued by a U.S. financial institution, but who otherwise does not take one of certain enumerated actions within the jurisdiction of the United States, cannot be prosecuted under section 1029(a)(3).  Such scenarios are not merely hypothetical.  United States law enforcement agencies have identified foreign-based individuals selling vast quantities of credit card numbers issued by U.S. financial institutions where there is no evidence that those criminals took a specific step within the United States to traffic in the data.  The United States has a compelling interest in prosecuting such individuals given the harm to U.S. financial institutions and American citizens, and the statute should be revised to cover this sort of criminal conduct.', \"  Deterring the Spread of Cell Phone SpyingThe Department of Justice further recommends a legislative change to enable law enforcement to seize the profits of those who use cell phone spyware.  The spread of computers and cellular phones in recent years has created a new market in malicious software that allows perpetrators to intercept victims' communications without their knowledge or consent.  This is illegal under current law, and current law also provides that law enforcement can forfeit the surreptitious interception devices themselves.  It does not, however, enable forfeiture of the proceeds of the sale or use of those devices, or the forfeiture of any property used to facilitate their manufacture, advertising, or distribution.  Further, the surreptitious interception of communications is currently not listed as a predicate offense in the money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. SS 1956.  Because perpetrators of these crimes often act from abroad, making it more difficult to prosecute them, it is particularly important that law enforcement be able to seize the money that the criminals make from engaging in this criminal surveillance, and seize the equipment they use. Selling Access to BotnetsWe also recommend amending current law to address the proliferation of botnets, such as the Coreflood botnet I discussed earlier.  Botnets can be used for various nefarious purposes, including theft of personal or financial information, the dissemination of spam, and cyberattacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service attacks.  But creators and operators of botnets do not always commit those crimes themselves - frequently they sell, or even rent, access to the infected computers to others. The CFAA does not clearly cover such trafficking in botnets, even though trafficking in infected computers is clearly illegitimate, and can be essential to furthering other criminal activity. We thus propose that the CFAA be amended to cover trafficking in access to botnets.\", \"  In addition, section 1030(a)(6) presently requires proof of intent to defraud.  Such intent is often difficult to prove because the traffickers of unauthorized access to computers often have a wrongful purpose other than the commission of fraud, or do not know or care why their customers are seeking unauthorized access to other people's computers. This has made it more challenging in many cases for prosecutors to identify a provable offense even when they can establish beyond a reasonable doubt that individuals are selling access to thousands of infected computers. We therefore recommend that Congress consider amending the CFAA to address this shortcoming.Conclusion\", '  I very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you the ways in which the Department protects American citizens and businesses by aggressively investigating and prosecuting hackers - both outsiders and insiders. We understand how devastating it is to victims of cybercrime who have their personal and financial information siphoned away, whether by hackers on the other side of the world or by insiders at a company that might hold their personal information. The Justice Department is committed to using the full range of investigative tools and laws available to us to fight these crimes and protect Americans. And, we will continue to use these tools responsibly.', \"  Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department's work in this area, and I look forward to answering any questions you might have.\", '  # # # ']\n",

      "[\"  A manufacturer and exporter of wind turbines based in the People's Republic of China, two employees of that manufacturer and a former employee of a subsidiary of AMSC, a United States-based company formerly known as American Superconductor Inc., were charged today with stealing trade secrets from AMSC causing an alleged loss of more than $800 million to the company, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman of the Justice Department's Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin John W. Vaudreuil. \", \"  A federal grand jury in the Western District of Wisconsin returned an indictment charging Sinovel Wind Group Co. Ltd., dba Sinovel Wind Group (USA) Co.

Stamping out intellectual property theft is a top priority for this administration, and we will continue to work with our IP Task Force partners to ensure that American ingenuity is protected.\"', '  \"The allegations in this indictment describe a well-planned attack on an American business by international defendants--nothing short of attempted corporate homicide,\" said U.S. Attorney Vaudreuil.  \"The Department of Justice and this office are committed to protecting American commerce and aggressively prosecuting those who seek to steal and use our intellectual property.  I commend the efforts of the FBI and their Austrian counterparts in this long-term international investigation, and the assistance provided by the owners and operators of the Massachusetts turbines.\" ', '  \"The Sinovel case is a classic example of the growing insider threat facing our nation\\'s corporations and their intellectual property,\" said FBI Executive Assistant Director Richard McFeely. \"The FBI will not stand by and watch the hemorrhage of U.S. intellectual property to foreign countries who seek to gain an unfair advantage for their military and their industries. We are actively working with our private sector and government partners to disrupt and impact those who have made it their mission to steal U.S. military and corporate secrets.

Su and Zhao are Chinese nationals living in China, and Karabasevic is a Serbian national who lived in Austria, but now lives in Serbia.', \"              According to the indictment, AMSC developed and sold software and equipment to regulate the flow of electricity from wind turbines to electrical grids, and it considered the software and equipment to be trade secrets and proprietary information.  The software that runs the PM3000, a part of AMSC's wind turbine electrical control system, was developed in Wisconsin and was stored on a computer in AMSC's office in Middleton, Wis.  The PM3000 worked with other products, including AMSC's Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) software.  The LVRT system is designed to keep a wind turbine operational when there is a temporary sag or dip in flow of electricity in the electrical grid. \", \"              Sinovel purchased software and equipment from AMSC for the wind turbines that Sinovel manufactured, sold and serviced.

      "[\"  Mythili Raman, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice; Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York; Steven G. Hughes, Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Office of the U.S. Secret Service; Richard Weber, Chief of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); and James T. Hayes Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging Liberty Reserve, a company that operated one of the world's most widely used digital currency services, and seven of its principals and employees with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.  Liberty Reserve is alleged to have had more than one million users worldwide, including more than 200,000 users in the U.S., who conducted approximately 55 million transactions - virtually all of which were illegal - and laundered more than $6 billion in suspected proceeds of crimes including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography and narcotics trafficking. \", '   ', \"  Five defendants were arrested on May 24, 2013, including Arthur Budovsky, the principal founder of Liberty Reserve, who was arrested in Spain; Vladmir Kats, the co-founder of Liberty Reserve, who was arrested in Brooklyn, New York; Azzeddine El Amine, a manager of Liberty Reserve's financial accounts, who was arrested in Spain; and Mark Marmilev and Maxim Chukharev, who helped design and maintain Liberty Reserve's technological infrastructure, who were arrested in Brooklyn and Costa Rica, respectively.  Two other defendants, Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani (Yassine) and Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez (Hidalgo), are at large in Costa Rica. \", '   ', '  In addition to the criminal charges brought in the indictment, five domain names were seized, namely, the domain name of Liberty Reserve and the domain names of four exchanger websites that were controlled by one or more of the defendants; 45 bank accounts were restrained or seized; and a civil action was filed against 35 exchanger websites seeking the forfeiture of the exchangers\\' domain names because the websites were used to facilitate the Liberty Reserve money laundering conspiracy and constitute property involved in money laundering.  The four exchangers whose domain names were seized, as well as the 35 exchangers whose domain names are the subjects of the civil forfeiture action, were all exchangers that transacted business with Liberty Reserve and were listed on Liberty Reserve\\'s website as \"pre-approved exchangers.\"  The investigation and takedown involved law enforcement action in 17 countries, including Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Spain, Morocco, Sweden, Switzerland, Cyprus, Australia, China, Norway, Latvia, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada and the U.S.', '   ', '  In a coordinated action, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network today announced that Liberty Reserve has been named as a financial institution of primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  This action includes a notice to the Federal Register proposing to prohibit covered U.S. financial institutions from opening or maintaining correspondent or payable-through accounts for foreign banks that are being used to process transactions involving Liberty Reserve.', '   ', '  Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman said: \"As charged, Liberty Reserve operated, on an enormous scale, a digital currency system designed to provide cyber and other criminals with a way to launder their profits without leaving a trace.  The company\\'s very purpose was to launder its users\\' criminal proceeds through the U.S. and global financial system.  By indicting Liberty Reserve and its principals, restraining over $25 million in criminal proceeds, forfeiting domain names, and seizing servers in countries around the globe, our message is clear:  money launderers can run, but they can\\'t hide from the U.S. justice system.  Combating the threat of global illicit finance requires using every tool we have at our disposal, and today we demonstrate our resolve to ensure that criminals who exploit the U.S. and global financial system will be held to account.\"', '   ', '  U.S. Attorney Bharara said: \" As alleged, the only liberty that Liberty Reserve gave many of its users was the freedom to commit crimes - the coin of its realm was anonymity, and it became a popular hub for fraudsters, hackers, and traffickers.   The global enforcement action we announce today is an important step towards reining in the \\'Wild West\\' of illicit Internet banking.  As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth.\"', '   ', '  Secret Service Special Agent-in-Charge Hughes said: \"These arrests are an example of the Secret Service\\'s commitment to investigate and apprehend criminals engaged in the misuse of virtual currencies to conduct global monetary fraud.  Cyber criminals should be reminded today that they are unable to hide behind the anonymity of the Internet to avoid regulated financial systems.  We are grateful to our many law enforcement partners throughout the world for assistance in this investigation, especially in Costa Rica, Spain and the Netherlands.\"', '   ', '  IRS-CI Chief Weber said: \"We are now entering the cyber age of money laundering.  Technology advancements over the past several years have dramatically increased opportunities for criminals to move, conceal and enjoy their ill-gotten gains. Liberty Reserve and its principals have been charged with operating a sophisticated and complex system for structuring financial transactions which catered to those engaged in such criminal activity.  What they did not anticipate was our robust partnerships with domestic and foreign law enforcement that allowed us collectively to follow the cyber money trail in the United States and around the world.\"', '   ', '  ICE HSI Special Agent-in-Charge Hayes said: \"The actions of the U.S. Secret Service, IRS, and HSI in dismantling the Liberty Reserve operation are critical because transnational criminal organizations can succeed only so long as they can funnel their illicit proceeds freely and without detection.  HSI is proud of its partnership through the Global Illicit Financial Team and will continue to aggressively target financial institutions that deliberately enable businesses and individuals to evade global financial systems in furtherance of criminal schemes.\"', '   ', '  According to the allegations in the indictment, the civil forfeiture complaint, and other documents filed in federal court:', '   ', ' Background', '  ', '  Liberty Reserve was incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006 and operated the digital currency commonly referred to as \"LR.\" While the company billed itself as the Internet\\'s \"largest payment processor and money transfer system,\" serving \"millions\" of people around the world, including the U.S., at no time did the company register with the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a money transmitting business, as required by law.', '   ', \"  Budovsky, the principal founder of Liberty Reserve, directed and supervised its operations, finances, and corporate strategy.  Kats, a co-founder, helped operate the company until 2009.  The day-to-day operations of Liberty Reserve were managed, at different times, by Hidalgo and Yassine.  El Amine managed various financial accounts controlled by Liberty Reserve, while Marmilev and Chukharev were primarily responsible for designing and maintaining the company's technological infrastructure. \", '  ', \" Overview of Liberty Reserve's Money Laundering Operation\", '   ', '  The defendants created, structured and operated Liberty Reserve as a criminal bank-payment processor designed to help users conduct illegal transactions anonymously and launder the proceeds of their crimes.  It emerged as one of the principal money transfer agents used by cyber criminals around the world to distribute, store, and launder the proceeds of their illegal activity.  The company grew into a financial hub of the cybercrime world, facilitating a broad range of online criminal activity, including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography and narcotics trafficking.  Liberty Reserve was used extensively for illegal purposes, functioning as the bank of choice for the criminal underworld because it provided an infrastructure that enabled cyber criminals around the world to conduct anonymous and untraceable financial transactions.', '   ', '  The defendants also protected the criminal infrastructure of Liberty Reserve by, among other things, lying to anti-money laundering authorities in Costa Rica and pretending to shut down Liberty Reserve after learning the company was being investigated by U.S. law enforcement.  They then continued operating the business through a set of shell companies, and moved tens of millions of dollars through shell company accounts maintained in Cyprus, Russia, China, Hong Kong, Morocco, Spain, Australia and elsewhere.', '  ', ' The Criminal Design of Liberty Reserve', '   ', '  In order to use LR currency, a user first had to open an account through the Liberty Reserve website and provide basic identifying information.  Unlike traditional banks or legitimate online processors, Liberty Reserve did not require users to validate their identities.  Users routinely established accounts under false names, including such blatantly criminal names as \"Russia Hackers\" and \"Hacker Account.\"  As part of the investigation, a law enforcement agent opened and executed transactions through an undercover account at Liberty Reserve in the name of \"Joe Bogus\" and the address \"123 Fake Main Street\" in \"Completely Made Up City, New York.\"', '             ', '  Once an account was established, the user could conduct transactions with other Liberty Reserve users.  In these transactions, the user could receive transfers of LR from other users\\' accounts, and transfer LR from his or her own account to other users, including any \"merchants\" that accepted LR as payment.  Liberty Reserve charged a one-percent fee up to a maximum of $2.99, every time a user transferred LR to another user through the Liberty Reserve system.  For an additional \"privacy fee\" of 75 cents per transaction, a user could hide his or her own Liberty Reserve account number when transferring funds, effectively making the transfer completely untraceable, even within Liberty Reserve\\'s already opaque system.    ', '   ', '  To add an additional layer of anonymity, Liberty Reserve did not permit users to fund their accounts by transferring money to the company directly through a credit card transfer or other means.  Users also could not withdraw funds from their accounts directly.  Instead, Liberty Reserve users were required to make any deposits or withdrawals through the use of third-party \"exchangers,\" which enabled the company to avoid collecting any information about its users through banking transactions or other activity that would leave a centralized financial paper trail.  Budovsky, Kats and El Amine owned and operated certain Liberty Reserve exchanger services.', '   ', '  The Liberty Reserve website recommended a number of \"pre-approved\" exchangers, which tended to be unlicensed money transmitting businesses operating in countries without significant governmental money laundering oversight or regulation, such as in Malaysia, Russia, Nigeria, and Vietnam.  The exchangers charged transaction fees for their services that were much higher than the fees charged by mainstream banks or payment processors for comparable money transfers.', '   ', ' The Criminal Use of Liberty Reserve', '   ', '  To further enable the use of Liberty Reserve for criminal activity, its website offered a \"shopping cart interface\" that \"merchant\" websites could use to accept LR currency as a form of payment.  The \"merchants\" who accepted LR currency were overwhelmingly criminal in nature.  They included traffickers of stolen credit card data and personal identity information, peddlers of various types of online Ponzi and get-rich-quick schemes, computer hackers for hire, unregulated gambling enterprises, and underground drug-dealing websites. ', '   ', '  In addition to being used to process payments for illegal goods and services online, Liberty Reserve was also used by cyber criminals to launder criminal proceeds and transfer funds among criminal associates.  For example, Liberty Reserve was used by credit-card theft and computer-hacking rings operating in countries around the world, including Vietnam, Nigeria, Hong Kong, China, and the U.S., to distribute proceeds of these conspiracies among the members involved.', '   ', '  The defendants were well aware that Liberty Reserve functioned as an unlawful money-laundering enterprise.  In an online chat between Kats and Yassine that was captured by law enforcement, Kats explicitly described Liberty Reserve\\'s activities as \"illegal\" and noted that \"everyone in USA\" such as \"DOJ\" knows \"LR is [a] money laundering operation that hackers use.\"', '             ', '  *                *                *', '   ', '  Liberty Reserve, Budovsky, 39, a citizen of Costa Rica who resides in the Netherlands, Kats, 41, of Brooklyn, New YorkYassine, 42, of Costa RicaHidalgo, 28, of Costa Rica,El Amine, 46, of Costa Rica,Marmilev, 33, of Brooklyn, New York, and Chukharev, 27, of Costa Rica,are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum term of five years in prison, and operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum term of five years in prison.  The terms of incarceration apply to the individual defendants.

      "[\"       Good afternoon, Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the Subcommittee.  It is an honor to appear before you to testify about investigating and prosecuting cyber threats to our nation and the resources required to do so.  I am pleased to share with the Subcommittee an overview of the Department of Justice's role in the U.S. Government's overall investigative strategy and enforcement efforts as it relates to cyber.  The President's 2014 budget also has some funding requests that would enhance our ability to address these threats.  I will provide more detail later in my remarks.  The Department's approach to 21st Century cyber threats is rooted in three interests: 1) deterring, disrupting, and dismantling the threat; 2) holding bad actors accountable; and 3) protecting our national security, economic interests, and individual privacy.\", '      As United States Attorney, I see the full range of threats our communities and nation face.  Few things are as sobering as the daily cyber threat briefing I receive.  Cyberspace is the new frontier.  We have witnessed the rapid creation of incredible businesses, lifesaving technologies, and new ways to connect society.  Unfortunately, the \"good guys\" are not the only innovators.  We have seen a significant growth in the number and nature of bad actors exploiting new technology. As Attorney General Holder has noted, \"    [f]rom criminal syndicates, to terrorist organizations, to foreign intelligence groups, to disgruntled employees and other malicious intruders, the range of entities that stand ready to execute and exploit cyber attacks has never been greater.\"    Threats to the nation\\'s computer networks and cyber systems continue to evolve, as the nature and capabilities of those responsible for the threats evolve. Over the last several years, investigators and prosecutors have seen significant increases in the skills of threat actors and the complexity of their organizations.  These actors have a variety of aims and motivations.  For instance: ', '      Responding to these threats requires a multi-faceted approach, including diplomacy and public-private partnerships.  The Department, acting with its law enforcement components and in partnership with other agencies, plays a critical role by identifying the offenders, seizing their hardware and assets, and deterring their conduct through, among other things, indictment, arrest, prosecution, and appropriate punishment.  In doing so, the Department works closely with other agencies and private sector entities to reduce vulnerabilities. Stated another way, we need to develop better locks, but when those locks are broken--as they inevitably will be--the Department responds to bring the offenders to justice.', \"      Our reliance on technology requires that we take action to protect not only the information infrastructure itself, but the data it carries and activity that it supports. The Administration is committed to integrating and organizing the government's cybersecurity efforts to better ensure that we have a comprehensive framework in place that will allow us to bring all of our collective tools to bear in the fight against cyber criminals, terrorists, and other adversaries. The Department of Justice plays a key role in that fight.\", '     Nature of the Threat', '      Ten years ago, many of the threats to the burgeoning Internet came from solo hackers, writing viruses like \"I love you\" or \"Melissa,\" or crafting denial of service attacks on fledgling Internet companies. As bothersome as those attacks were, the threats today are much more significant. We face the challenges of organized crime, botnets (i.e., a collection of compromised computers under the remote command and control of a criminal or foreign adversary), identity theft, and carding, to name just a few. Many of these threats originate overseas.', '       However, we face significant challenges in attributing the origin of these threats. The tools used to commit serious cyber theft and damage are not only wielded by those with large-scale development resources.  Instead, using widely available tools, individuals or small groups can steal huge quantities of sensitive data, damage key computer systems, or silence those who disagree. Financial gains from these crimes can, in turn, be used to build larger networks and buy protection from foreign government officials.  As a result, U.S. investigators working to determine the source and nature of a cyber threat often do not know at the outset whether an attack was mounted by an individual acting alone, an organized criminal or terrorist group, or a hostile nation.', \"      Every day, criminals hunt for our personal and financial data so that they can use it to commit fraud or sell it to other criminals. The technology revolution has facilitated these activities, making available a wide array of new methods that identity thieves can use to access and exploit the personal information of others.  Skilled criminal hackers are now able to perpetrate large-scale data breaches that leave hundreds of thousands--and in many cases, tens of millions--of individuals at risk of identity theft.  Today's criminals can remotely access the computer systems of universities, merchants, financial institutions, credit card companies, and data processors to steal large volumes of personal information--including financial information.  As I explain below, we are working hard to address these threats to personal information.\", '      The most significant threats are continuing to evolve, and now increasingly include threats to corporate data.  A 2011 report from     McAfee and Science Applications International Corporation confirms this trend in cybercrime.  According to this report, which was based on a survey of more than 1,000 senior IT decision makers in several countries,   high-end\" cyber criminals have shifted from targeting credit cards and other personal data to the intellectual capital of large corporations.  This includes extremely valuable trade secrets and product-planning documents.  ', '      These threats come both from outside criminal hackers as well as insiders who gain access to critical information from within companies and government agencies.  Trusted insiders pose particular risks.  Those inside U.S. corporations and agencies may exploit their access to funnel information to criminals, competitors or foreign nation states.  And once the enemy is inside the gates, external defense can only provide limited protection. The Justice Department has successfully prosecuted corporate insiders and others who have obtained trade secrets or technical data from major U.S. companies and routed them to other nations via cyberspace.', '      The massive proceeds from these online crimes create another troubling issue.  It is too soon to say where that money ends up, but the risk that it is being used to influence foreign governments, distort foreign justice systems, and fund terrorists cannot be ignored.', \"      The national security cyber threat picture has similarly undergone a dramatic evolution in recent years.  Although we have not yet experienced a devastating cyber attack against our critical infrastructure, we have been victim to a range of cyber activities that have siphoned off our valuable economic assets or had other effects on our infrastructure, threatening our nation's security.  \", '      These threats are as varied as the actors who carry them out.  While details about most of the state-sponsored intrusions remain classified, the Intelligence Community has publicly noted that \"entities within China and Russia are responsible for extensive illicit intrusions into US computer networks and theft of US intellectual property.\"  Indeed, \"Chinese actors are,\" according to a 2011 public report of our top counterintelligence officials, \"the world\\'s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage.\"  The Secretary of Defense has stated that \"Iran has also undertaken a concerted effort to use cyberspace to its advantage.\"  ', '      Likewise, the threat of cyber-enabled terrorism looms large. While terrorists have not yet used the Internet to launch a full-scale cyber attack against the United States, they already use cyberspace for more than merely spreading propaganda and recruiting followers - they have used cyberspace to facilitate operations.  The individuals who planned the attempted Times Square bombing in May 2010, for instance, used public web cameras for reconnaissance, file sharing sites to share operational details, and remote conferencing software to communicate. In addition, they have exhorted their followers to engage in cyber attacks on America.  Last year, an al-Qaeda video released publicly by the Senate Homeland Security Committee encouraged al-Qaeda followers to engage in \"electronic jihad\" by carrying out cyber attacks against the West.  ', '      The national security cyber threats posed by state-sponsored actors and terrorists are growing, and although to date they have resembled in some ways the crimes perpetrated by financially-motivated criminals, their emergence and evolution make the threat of cyber-generated physical attacks, like those that might disrupt the power grid, appear no longer to be the stuff of science fiction.  Leaders in our national security community have predicted that the cyber threat \"will pose the number one threat to our country\" in \"the not too distant future.\"  Accordingly, just as the Department realigned its counterterrorism efforts after 9/11, we are realigning our cyber efforts to meet this challenge.', '   Addressing these complex threats requires a unified approach, one that incorporates criminal investigative and prosecutorial tools, civil and national security authorities, diplomatic tools, public-private partnerships, and international cooperation. Criminal prosecution, whether in the United States or a partner country, plays a central and critical role in this collaborative effort.  While prosecution is not the appropriate approach for every threat that affects the United States, identifying and understanding the threat will very often involve the use of criminal investigative tools and methods.', ' Role of the Department of Justice ', \"      A key part of the nation's overall cybersecurity effort is the investigation and prosecution of cyber criminals - be they financially motivated actors, criminal hackers, terrorists, or state actors.  Our goal is to stop or deter these actors before they can complete an attack on our networks, or to punish and deter similar acts in the future if a successful intrusion has already occurred.  Many Department of Justice components--including the Criminal and National Security Divisions and United States Attorneys' offices across the country--are actively working to counter these threats.\", '      These cases can be complex to investigate and prosecute.  We need to ensure we have the investigative expertise and forensic capabilities needed to meet the challenge.  We appreciate the support this committee has given in this regard.  Almost every federal case prosecuted now involves an increasing volume of digital evidence, sometime scattered over numerous devices and multiple online services. For example, in one recent case in our District, the target carried as many as 15 cell phones.  Gathering, sifting, and analyzing digital evidence is an increasing challenge. Bad actors know how to hide their cyber tracks: evidence can disappear with a few key strokes, or through malicious code set as a booby trap.  Moreover, large cyber cases frequently involve multiple players in     multiple states and countries.  One significant case can require multiple agents and several years to investigate.  Obtaining evidence from foreign countries - even those that are strong allies - can take time, delay, and require translating voluminous foreign language evidence.  ', \"      To meet these challenges, the Department has organized itself to ensure that we are in a position to aggressively investigate and prosecute cybercrime wherever it occurs.  The Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and a nationwide network of Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs), including nearly 300 AUSAs designated as Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP) prosecutors lead our efforts to investigate and prosecute cybercrime offenses.  These prosecutors, as well as other Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs) working cybercrime cases throughout the country, work closely with our law enforcement partners, including the FBI, the Secret Service, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.  In addition, we have a strong partnership with the FBI's National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), which brings together law enforcement, intelligence, and defense agencies to focus on high-priority cyber threats.  \", \"      Other sections of the Criminal Division also play important roles in cybersecurity.  The Fraud Section focuses on large-scale fraud cases involving identity theft.  The Office of International Affairs (OIA) supports and enhances international cooperation efforts by expediting the sharing of critical electronic evidence with foreign law enforcement partners and by marshaling efforts to secure the extradition of international fugitives.  Increasingly, large scale cyber cases involve actors from any number of foreign countries.  OIA not only secures evidence and international fugitives from abroad, it also plays a central role in cultivating law enforcement cooperation with foreign partners by complying with the United States' reciprocal obligations to provide U.S.-based evidence to foreign authorities for their investigations.  International cooperation is critical and the work of OIA a key component of our success.\", \"      The Department's National Security Division     (NSD) pursues national security cyber threats through a variety of means, including through counterespionage and counterterrorism investigations and prosecutions.      The Counterespionage Section (CES) prosecutes, among other offenses, misappropriation of intellectual property to benefit a foreign government, as provided by the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. SS 1831), and obtaining national defense, foreign relations, or restricted data by accessing a computer without authorization, as provided by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. SS 1030).  The Counterterrorism Section (CTS)--leveraging the capabilities and expertise of CCIPS, the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and others--would     play a pivotal role in addressing any potential cybersecurity attack by terrorists or associated groups or individuals. NSD also   provides the FBI, and the intelligence community in general, with extensive legal support on cyber issues.    \", '      Recognizing the diversity of national security cyber threats and the need for a coordinated approach to them, the Department also established last year a nationwide network of National Security Cyber Specialists (referred to as the \"NSCS network\").  The network brings together the Department\\'s full range of expertise on national security-related cyber matters, drawing on experts from NSD, the U.S. Attorney\\'s Offices, CCIPS, and other DOJ components.  This network seeks to build on the successes of existing initiatives, including the CHIP network and the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council.  Each U.S. Attorney\\'s office around the country has designated a point of contact for the National Security Cyber Specialists network.   Last year, approximately 120 Assistant U.S. Attorneys and presenters convened in Washington, D.C. for a cyber training program to kick off the NSCS program.', \"      The NSCS network now serves as a centralized resource for prosecutors and agents around the country.  The network has focused the Department nationwide on opening more national security cyber investigations with an eye toward criminal prosecution.  Through this network, we are bringing our best resources to bear against the problem--to enhance information sharing, ensure coordination, and leverage the Department's expertise in legal authorities and advice relating to national security cyber threats.  Finally, we are using this network to do more outreach to the private sector and to enhance our joint work with the NCIJTF.\", \"      In addition to these efforts, the Department works closely with our partners throughout the government--including law enforcement agencies, the Intelligence Community, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Commerce, and the Department of Defense--to provide legal support to cybersecurity efforts and inform policy discussions.  The intersection between laws and technology can require complicated analysis and multidisciplinary training.  That is why the Department has lawyers in US Attorneys offices, and the Criminal and National Security Divisions, who are specially trained to handle cyber issues, ranging from the use of existing legal tools and authorities, the legality of cybersecurity programs like the EINSTEIN program, and the ways in which we can vigorously protect privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties while still achieving our goal of securing the Nation's networks.  Partnering with the National Science Foundation (NSF), through NSF's       CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) program - which seeks to increase the number of qualified students entering the fields of information assurance and computer security and to increase the capacity of the U.S. higher education enterprise to continue to produce professionals in these fields to meet the needs of our increasingly technological society - the Department currently employs more than 40 SFS CyberCorps graduates, including 17 working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  \", \"      For example, the Department is currently providing legal and policy advice to the Department of Homeland Security in support of its cybersecurity mission and to the National Security Agency in support of its information assurance efforts.  We are participating in government-wide planning and preparedness efforts, such as the development of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan and the associated Cyber Unified Coordination Group, which assists the Secretary of DHS in coordinating responsive measures to significant cyber incidents.  We also participate in cyber exercises, such as 2012's National Level Exercise, and, along with other governmental partners, in reviewing the national security implications and vulnerabilities of certain foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies, including those with cyber-related capabilities. \", '      Our work does not stop at our shores.  Due to the global nature of the Internet, many of our cases involve computers and electronic evidence located in other countries.  Many times the offenders are located in another country.  Even U.S. criminals will use computers located in another country to hide their tracks.  Often it is impossible to identify, arrest, and prosecute offenders without the assistance of foreign governments.', '      To assist us in preserving and obtaining evidence from other nations, the Department,     with funding support from the Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, has engaged in numerous efforts to enhance the ability of foreign governments to fight cybercrime, including:', '    *               Promoting the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (2001);', '    *               Providing technical expertise to countries developing their legal frameworks relating to computer crime and electronic evidence;', '    *               Providing U.S.-based evidence through mutual legal assistance treaties to aid foreign investigations;', '    *               Providing capacity building assistance for foreign law enforcement agencies; and ', '    *               Promoting the 24/7 High-Tech Crimes Network of the G8, which is a network of points of contact designed to facilitate rapid law enforcement coordination across borders. ', '       The profusion and diversity of cyber threats, and the challenges inherent in identifying and addressing them, highlight the need for a whole-of-government approach--an all-tools approach--to combating cyber threats.  As Director Mueller has said, \"We must be willing to use whatever legal means are available and appropriate--civil, criminal, or other means--to disrupt a particular threat--whether it be a terrorist threat or a cyber threat.\" Just as law enforcement and other legal tools have been critical in our efforts to combat organized crime, terrorist threats, and espionage, so too will they be critical to the deterrence and disruption of cyber threats.  ', '    Operational Successes', \"      The relationships between the Department's prosecuting components and the federal investigative agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the robust cooperation and information sharing that they support, have led to a number of enforcement successes. In FY 2012, computer intrusion investigations resulted in 138 convictions and pre-trial diversions.  I would like to highlight a few here. \", '   International, Multi-state Carding Ring -   In my District, we prosecuted participants at all levels of an international credit card skimming ring from a Secret Service investigation.  Christopher A. Schroebel  , 21, of Keedysville, Maryland, obtained credit card information by hacking into vulnerable point of sale computers in small business operations across the country, including one in the Seattle area.  Tens of thousands of people were victimized, and the investigation indicated that over 100,000 credit cards were compromised.  David Benjamin Schrooten, 22, a Dutch citizen living in Romania sold the card numbers for a profit by advertising them on \"carding websites.\"  Charles Tony Williamson, 33, of Torrance, California, has also been charged with buying the card numbers for his criminal group to use in multiple frauds.  Schroebel was sentenced to seven years in prison, Schrooten received a twelve year sentence, and Williamson is awaiting trial.  ', \" Prolific Identity Thief and Hacker Sentenced. Following a complex Secret Service investigation,on July 18, 2012, a court in the Eastern District of New York sentenced Aleksandr Suvorov to seven years in prison following his 2009 plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and his 2011 plea to trafficking in unauthorized access devices. Suvorov, an Estonian, was extradited from Germany in 2009.  Along with Albert Gonzalez and Maksym Yastremskiy, he participated in a massive hacking scheme involving retail merchants.  The May 2009 pleas, for example, involved a hack into the Dave & Buster's restaurant chain in which the group stole names and account numbers for approximately 110,000 credit card accounts.  Gonzalez, arguably the most prolific identity thief in American history, had already pled guilty and was sentenced in March 2010 to 20 years in prison.  Yastremskiy earlier received a 30-year prison term in Turkey for identity theft and related crimes.\", ' ', '    Coreflood Botnet Takedown. In April 2011, the government filed a civil complaint against 13 \"John Doe\" defendants, alleging that they ran the Coreflood Botnet in order to engage in wire fraud, bank fraud, and illegal interception of electronic communications.  At its peak, the group had control over several million computers infected with the Coreflood malware.  Search warrants were obtained for computer servers throughout the country, and a seizure warrant was obtained for 29 domain names. The government also obtained a temporary restraining order (later followed by a preliminary and permanent injunction), authorizing the government to respond to signals sent from infected computers in the U.S. in order to stop the Coreflood software from running, thereby preventing further harm to hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting users of infected computers in the United States.  Over the next month, the Coreflood Botnet was effectively eliminated.', ' ', ' Charges Brought Against Six Leaders of Anonymous and Related Criminal Hacking Collectives.  In March 2012, the Southern District of New York (SDNY) unsealed charges against five criminal computer hackers in the United States and abroad who identified themselves as aligned with the online group \"Anonymous\" and/or related offshoot groups including \"Internet Feds,\" \"LulzSec,\" and \"AntiSec.\"  SDNY unsealed one indictment that charged Ryan Ackroyd, aka \"kayla\"; Jake Davis, aka \"topiary,\"; Darren Martyn, aka \"pwnsauce,\"; and Donncha O\\'Cearrbhail, aka \"palladium,\" with computer hacking conspiracy involving the hacks of Fox Broadcasting Company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), among others.  In addition, SDNY unsealed the guilty plea of Hector Xavier Monsegur, aka \"Sabu,\" the former head of Anonymous and LulzSec who had been cooperating with the FBI since his arrest in the Southern District of New York in June 2011.  Monsegur pleaded guilty not only to charges in SDNY, but also to substantive hacking charges filed by four other U.S. Attorney\\'s Offices --  Eastern District of California (hacks of HBGary, Inc. and HBGary Federal LLC), Central District of California (hacks of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Fox Broadcasting Company) , Northern District of Georgia (hack of Infraguard Members Alliance), and Eastern District of Virginia (hack of PBS).  Finally, the FBI arrested Jeremy Hammond, aka \"Anarchaos,\" who identified himself as a member of \"AntiSec,\" on a complaint in SDNY that charged him in connection with the hack of Stratfor, a global intelligence firm based in Austin, Texas.', ' ', ' Notorious Criminal Hacker and Identity Thief Surrendered by France to the U.S.  On April 5, 2013, Vladislav Anatolievich Horohorin, a/k/a \"BadB\" was sentenced to 88 months in prison by Judge Huvelle in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Horohorin, a citizen of Russia, Ukraine, and Israel, was a major vendor of stolen credit and debit cards who possessed more than 2.5 million stolen account numbers at the time of his arrest.  Horohorin also participated in the intrusion at Atlanta-based RBS Worldpay in 2008, in which an international criminal group that     completed more than 15,000 fraudulent transactions at over 2,100 ATMs in at least 280 cities worldwide in a 12-hour period in November 2008, causing more than $9.4 million in losses.  Horohorin was extradited to the United States from France, where he was arrested on August 8, 2010 at the request of U.S. authorities.', '    Romanian \"Point-of-Sales\" Criminal Hackers Extradited to U.S. Following an extensive Secret Service investigation, on May 4, 2011, a federal grand jury in Concord, New Hampshire, returned an indictment charging Adrian-Tiberiu Oprea, Cezar Iulian Butu, Iulian Dolan, and Florin Radu, all residents of Romania, with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, wire fraud, and access device fraud.  The defendants were part of a group that, beginning in 2008, remotely hacked into Subways\\' and other merchants\\' \"checkout\"  or \"point-of-sales\" computer systems; surreptitiously installed \"keystroke logging\" software, which in turn recorded and stored customers\\' credit, debit, and gift card data; electronically transferred the stolen card data to several U.S.-based computer servers (\"dump sites\") and from there to a server in Cyprus, for temporary storage;  and then made unauthorized charges on the compromised accounts and sold stolen card data to other co-conspirators.  Members of the conspiracy have compromised over 146,000 accounts and have made unauthorized charges in excess of $10,000,000 on these compromised accounts.  Dolan and Butu, were arrested upon their entry to the United States in August 2011, have pled guilty, and remain in United States custody awaiting sentencing. Adrian-Tiberiu Oprea, 28, of Constanta, Romania, was extradited from Romania to the United States and appeared in federal court in New Hampshire on May 29, 2012.  Radu is currently at large.', ' ', \" Operator of Worldwide Spam Botnet Convicted. On February 27, 2013, Oleg Nikolaenko, 25, a citizen of Russia who entered the United States on a tourist visa, was sentenced to time served (just over 27 months) in the Eastern District of Wisconsin following an earlier guilty plea.  According to court documents, Nikolaenko operated and controlled the Mega-D botnet, which was at one time the world's largest spam botnet, accounting for approximately 32% of all spam worldwide.  A network security company estimates that approximately 509,000 computers worldwide were infected with Mega-D botnet malware.\", ' ', ' Operation Trident Tribunal Takes Down International Crime Rings Distributing Scareware.  Operation Trident Tribunal is a coordinated international enforcement action targeting a cybercrime ring that caused over $71 million in losses to more than one million computer users by operating a \"scareware\" scheme.  Scareware is malicious software that cybercriminals plant on victim computers through a variety of computer exploits including the use of botnets, \"drive-by\" downloads, and criminal search engine manipulation.  The scheme uses a variety of ruses, including web pages featuring fake computer scans, to trick consumers into purchasing fake anti-virus software products at a cost of up to $129.  In June 2011, DOJ coordinated the efforts of law enforcement in over a dozen countries to seize dozens of servers that were being used to orchestrate this scheme.  Two Latvian nationals, four Ukrainian nationals, and a Swedish national were indicted in connection with the scheme, and five foreign bank accounts were frozen.', '      On January 19, 2012, defendant Mikael Patrick Sallnert, a citizen of Sweden, was arrested in Denmark and extradited to the United States.  Sallnert was a trusted payments processor for the scareware ring, responsible for processing funds fraudulently obtained from U.S. victims.  Sallnert pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of accessing a protected computer in furtherance of fraud on August 17, 2012, and was sentenced to 48 months in prison on December 14, 2012 by Judge Pechman in the Western District of Washington.', ' ', \"      These cases illustrate the broad scope of the Department's efforts to pursue cyber criminals.     While the Department is proud of these cases and all of our efforts to tackle the growing and evolving cybersecurity problem, we recognize that there is much more to be done, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement and private sector partners to meet that challenge.  Because of the global nature of the Internet and the related crimes it can facilitate, continued close coordination and cooperation with foreign law enforcement is critical to our collective success.  And because our prosecutors understand the severe damage that computer crimes can have upon a victim, we continue to pursue appropriate cases, both large and small.\", \"     Legislation to Enhance the Department's Ability to Combat Cyber Threats\", \"      As the threat increases and evolves, so must our legal tools to combat the threat.  In May 2011, as part of the Administration's Cybersecurity Proposal, the Department proposed some needed, moderate updates to the computer crime laws. We continue to believe that many of these proposals would enhance our ability to combat cyber threats, including:\", '      *                 A proposal to update the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") to make the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\") offenses subject to RICO.  The CFAA is the primary statute used to prosecute hacking crimes.  Computer technology has become a key tool of organized crime. Indeed, criminal organizations are operating today around the world to: hack into public and private computer systems, including systems key to national security and defense; hijack computers for the purpose of stealing identity and financial information; extort lawful businesses with threats to disrupt computers; and commit a range of other cybercrimes. Many of these criminal organizations are similarly tied to traditional Asian and Eastern European organized crime organizations. ', '      *                 A proposal to clarify and update the forfeiture provision of the CFAA.  This proposal would allow for civil forfeiture and clarify the rules governing criminal forfeiture under the statute.', \"      *                    A proposal to update the CFAA's sentencing provisions. The goal of these changes is to eliminate overly complex, confusing provisions; simplify the sentencing scheme; and enhance penalties in certain areas where the statutory maximums no longer reflect the severity of these crimes.  \", ' ', \"     Resources to Enhance the Department's Ability to Combat Cyber Threats\", \"      Because of the very serious nature of cyber threats, and the pressing need to respond to them, the Administration is asking for an enhancement to the Department's budget to target this critical problem.  These additional resources will help us to keep pace with the increased numbers and ever evolving sophistication of our adversaries. The Department's FY 2014 Budget proposal therefore provides a total of $668 million in cyber resources to address computer intrusions and cybercrimes and to defend the security of the Department's critical information networks. This request includes an increase of $92.6 million for the FBI, NSD, and the Criminal Division.\", \"      For the FBI, the budget includes an increase of $86.6 million and 152 positions (60 agents) to support the FBI's Next Generation Cyber Initiative, which will more strategically focus the FBI's efforts on the greatest cyber threat--intrusions into government and industry computer networks. The Next Generation Cyber Initiative combines national security and criminal investigative resources to more holistically approach multi-dimensional cybercrimes and to better leverage the full range of FBI authorities.  The requested funding will add 50 special agents and 50 computer scientists to increase cyber investigative capabilities and victim notification, enhance the capabilities and expertise of FBI investigative personnel, and improve the collection and analysis of electronic evidence. It will also extend centralized analytical capabilities to the field by deploying cyber workstations to serve as portals for communicating intrusion-related data bureau-wide.   \", '      Like the FBI, the Department\\'s National Security Division seeks to improve its capability to respond to cyber-based threats to the national security and the capability to respond.  Cyber-based threats to the national security are, according to the intelligence community \"increasing in scope and scale,\" and cyber-espionage in particular \"is almost certainly allowing our adversaries to close the technological gap between our respective militaries, slowly neutralizing one of our key advantages in the international arena.\"  NSD is involved in the full range of U.S. cyber and cyber security efforts, including cyber threat prevention, detection, disruption, investigation and prosecution, as well as oversight, vulnerability management, and cyber policy development.  As I mentioned above, last year NSD created the National Security Cyber Specialists Network to facilitate a threat-based approach, rather than a statute- or tool-based approach, to the national security cyber challenge. To this end, NSD is establishing \"threat focus\" cells of cyber specialists to focus on particular high-priority cyber targets.  The subject-matter experts who comprise such teams will serve as Departmental focal points for information about--and strategies designed to defeat--these identified cyber threats.  One such cell has already been created, and has successfully begun work on a significant threat actor.', \"      As NSD positions itself to better accomplish its cyber mission, and as it continues its work leading, expanding, and developing the NSCS Network, our first priority is ensuring that we have a well-equipped cyber workforce.  To achieve this goal, NSD must hire, equip, and train both new and existing personnel.  These additional resources are critical to ensuring that the Division's redoubled cyber efforts do not detract from ongoing, and critical, counterterrorism, counterespionage, and intelligence-related matters.  As a result, NSD has requested $3.5 million and 26 positions (16 attorneys) for FY14. This increase will enable NSD to strengthen its investigative, prosecutorial, intelligence collection, and oversight abilities to support the Intelligence Community in identifying and disrupting cyber threats to national security.\", \"      Similarly, the Criminal Division has seen a growth in cyber threats perpetrated by actors other than foreign nation states and terrorist organizations.  And as I mentioned before, criminal prosecution, whether in the United States or a partner country, plays a central and critical role in eliminating these threats.      In addition, while prosecution is not the appropriate     approach for every threat that affects the United States, identifying and understanding the threat will very often involve the use of criminal investigative tools and methods.   Just as the threats to our nation's invaluable proprietary and personal information are increasing, so must our innovation and our efforts to deter, disrupt, and prosecute those threat actors.   Studies have shown that the number of intrusions continues to increase, and the cost of cybercrime to American businesses and citizens likewise continues to mount.  The Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) has experienced a 42% increase in pending investigations and an 11% increase in pending prosecutions between FY 2010 and FY 2011.   The requested additional resources will help the Division  keep pace with the growing cyber caseload and should be viewed in tandem with the increase in FBI investigative resources for FY 2014.\", \"   A reality of cyber investigations is that it is nearly impossible to forecast where they will begin or end.  Consequently, the Division, through CCIPS, provides nation-wide support to investigations, prosecutions, and disruption efforts, helping to ensure that its law enforcement partners receive consistent, quality support whether the investigation's trail leads to Silicon Valley, rural America, or overseas.  As a result, Criminal Division prosecutors have led, or partnered in, some of the country's most significant data breach and computer intrusion cases, the success of which has required a comprehensive grasp of computer network technology and electronic evidence law and a subtle understanding of the often loosely organized worldwide groups that work together to plan and execute these attacks.  \", \"       CCIPS prosecutors work in direct cooperation with the CHIP network and investigative agencies to identify and address threat actors.  CCIPS houses prosecutors with a deep understanding of data breaches and computer misuse cases and prosecutors who understand the complexity of intellectual property cases to comprise a leading resource for deterring, investigating, and punishing the theft of sensitive electronic information. Consequently, every additional prosecutor in CCIPS becomes a force multiplier for the Department, leveraging its expertise wherever it is needed to the benefit of all USAOs and the achievement of the Department's cyber crime goals.\", \"      The Criminal Division is therefore requesting an increase of 25 positions (9 attorneys), 14 FTE, and $2,580,000. This enhancement will increase the Division's capability in four key areas: cybercrime investigations and prosecutions; advice to the field regarding legal tools and authorities; international cooperation and outreach; and forensic support. This increased capacity will allow the Division to successfully deter, investigate, and punish the theft of sensitive electronic information and other cybercrime. \", \"      Moreover, a critical part of the Department's efforts to combat cyber threats is international engagement.  As I have just described, criminals residing outside of our borders are a major component of the overall threat, and even criminals inside the U.S. commonly use computers overseas to store their tools, hide stolen data, and conceal their identities. Thus, a critical part of addressing the cyber threat is to improve our ability to work with law enforcement agencies in foreign governments to collect electronic evidence on our behalf and arrest and either extradite or prosecute cyber criminals.  \", '       The Criminal Division has long had a robust program for encouraging the development by foreign governments of laws, investigation and prosecution capacity, and appropriate infrastructure to address emerging cybercrime threats and capabilities.  From the development and maintenance of a 24/7 response capability in more than 50 countries aimed at preserving critical evidence before it is deleted, to its leading role in negotiating the first multilateral convention on cybercrime, to its regular engagement on training, policy, and operational issues with law enforcement partners around the world, the Division and its partners in the US Attorneys offices   have led the fight against transnational cybercrime.', '       Despite significant advances in law enforcement cooperation and understanding, criminals continue to use gaps and inefficiencies in international law enforcement capabilities to evade detection, attribution, and punishment.  Foreign authorities apply data protection regulations in ways that can frustrate investigations.  Delays in evidence collection can stop investigations almost at their inception.  And some of the myriad entities involved in providing Internet connectivity and domain registration have permitted the growth of \"data havens\" where criminal and other threat actors can commit crimes with relative impunity.  ', '       Despite these challenges, the Criminal Division has attempted to perform effective international outreach on cyber issues.  Using a balanced approach of frank policy discussions with countries that have similar capabilities, combined with multilateral training initiatives aimed at countries whose legal or technical infrastructure to address cyber threats is at an earlier developmental stage, the Division has continued to improve capacity to address cybercrime around the world.  CCIPS attorneys lead efforts to build capacity and law enforcement relationships in Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, including through multi-lateral organizations such as the Organization of American States and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.  As computer infrastructures expand in developing countries, and offenders who victimize Americans inevitably follow, the need for this sort of international engagement continues to grow.', \"      Having prosecutors stationed in foreign hotspots will contribute immeasurably to these efforts.  Consequently, the Criminal Division also requests an enhancement of 11 positions (including 7 attorneys), 6 FTE, and $3,500,000 to place four DOJ Attaches overseas. These DOJ Attaches will serve as regional International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property coordinators (ICHIPs).   This program will build on the existing Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator Program (IPLEC) that has proven to be very effective in enhancing the Department's goals in fighting international intellectual property crime.  Since 2006, the IPLEC Program has deployed experienced federal prosecutors overseas to take the lead on our intellectual property protection efforts in key regions including Asia and, until March 2011 (when State Department funding expired), Eastern Europe.   Through the IPLEC program, the Department has seen a substantial increase in foreign enforcement and cooperative casework where U.S. law enforcement has had a visible and ongoing presence in the most active countries or regions.  This enhancement request would allow for the expansion of the program to additional critical regions. \", '      The Department of Justice stands ready to work with the Committee as it examines these important issues.  We appreciate the opportunity to testify today, and we look forward to continuing to work with you.', '      This concludes my remarks.  I would be pleased to answer your questions.']\n"

      "[\"Thank you, Victoria, for those kind words - and thank you all for being here. It's a pleasure to welcome you to the White House today - and a privilege to stand with so many friends, key partners, and indispensable allies in introducing the Administration's strategy for combating the theft of trade secrets.\", \"As Victoria just mentioned, this work is a top priority for President Obama, for the entire Administration - and of course for the dedicated men and women at the Department of Justice. I'm deeply proud of the contributions that my colleagues have made in developing this strategy - and the pivotal role that the Department will play in its implementation. And I'm confident that - as we bring government agencies and additional private sector partners together to put these plans into action - we'll continue strengthening national efforts to protect the rights, safety, and best interests of American consumers, innovators, and entrepreneurs.\", 'Particularly in this time of ongoing economic recovery, this work is more important than ever. Despite the challenges of recent years, American companies remain the most innovative in the world. They are responsible for many of the most important technological advances the world has ever seen, an overwhelming number of the 100 most valuable brands, and almost 30 percent of global research and development spending.', 'This level of innovation and the investments that make it possible benefit consumers, create jobs, and support our economy. For instance, in 2011, companies in Silicon Valley added over 42,000 jobs and recorded a growth rate more than three times that of the U.S. economy as a whole. But, as any of the corporate leaders in this crowd can attest, this prosperity is a double-edged sword. And it inevitably attracts global rivals - including individuals, companies, and even countries - eager to tilt the playing field to their advantage.', 'By corrupting insiders, hiring hackers, and engaging in other unscrupulous and illegal activities, these entities can inflict devastating harm on individual creators, start-ups, and major companies. As one private security expert has said of the largest U.S. corporations, there are only \"two categories\" of companies affected by trade secret theft - \"[T]hose that know they\\'ve been compromised and those that don\\'t know yet.\"', \"This is because, as new technologies have torn down traditional barriers to international business and global commerce, they've also made it easier for criminals to steal trade secrets - and to do so from anywhere in the world. A hacker in China can acquire source code from a software company in Virginia without leaving his or her desk. With a few keystrokes, a terminated or simply unhappy employee of a defense contractor can misappropriate designs, processes, and formulas worth billions of dollars.\", \"Some of these criminals exploit pilfered secrets themselves - often by extorting the victim company or starting their own enterprise. Others try to sell the illicit information to a rival company, or obtain a bounty from a country interested in encouraging such theft. And all represent a significant and steadily increasing threat to America's economic and national security interests.\", 'Fortunately, the women and men of the Justice Department are working tirelessly to prevent, combat, and punish these serious crimes. Thanks to the efforts of 40 prosecutors and four computer forensic experts serving in the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and more than 230 specially-trained prosecutors stationed at U.S. Attorneys\\' Offices around the country, including 25 Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property - or \"CHIP\" - units, I\\'m pleased to report that we\\'re fighting back more aggressively, and collaboratively, than ever before. And with approximately 240 FBI agents in the field dedicated to investigating IP crime, along with officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and 20 additional state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies that are partners at the IPR Center, we are poised to build on our recent successes.', \"I'm proud of the outstanding work that these professionals are leading every day, in offices all across the country. But I also recognize - as I know you all do - that the Justice Department won't be able to continue making the progress we need, and that our citizens and companies deserve, on its own.\", \"We need to increase cooperation and coordination between partners at every level of government. We need to improve engagement with the corporations represented in the room today. We need to find ways to work together more efficiently and effectively - by following the road map set forth in the Administration's new, comprehensive strategy. And we need to do so starting immediately - because continuing technological expansion and accelerating globalization will lead to a dramatic increase in the threat posed by trade secret theft in the years ahead.\", 'In fact, by 2015, experts believe that the number of smart phones, tablets, laptops, and other internet-access devices in use will be roughly double the total that existed in 2010. In the same period, the proliferation of cloud-based computing will significantly enhance flexibility and productivity for workers around the world. But these same forces will also create more access points and vulnerabilities that allow criminals to steal confidential information.', 'Just as increasing globalization will enable American companies of all sizes to benefit from foreign technical experts and research and development activities in other countries, the sharing of trade secrets with entities operating in nations with weak rule of law may expose them to intellectual property losses. Any resulting cost advantages will likely be more than offset by losses in proprietary company information.', \"Unfortunately, these projections aren't merely hypothetical. We've seen this phenomenon before - including in the late 1990s, when I had the privilege of serving as Deputy Attorney General. Between 1997 and 2000, internet usage in the United States more than doubled - and this massive technological shift also brought about major changes in the nature of crime. For instance, in 1999 alone, we saw a 30-percent spike in intellectual property cases over the previous year. In order to fight back, in July of that year I announced the Department's first major IP Strategy, known as the Intellectual Property Rights Initiative.\", \"Of course, we've all come a long way since then. As critical technologies have advanced, criminals have adapted accordingly. Our need to keep pace with these changes remains imperative. And the stakes have never been higher.\", \"In some industries, a single trade secret can be worth millions - or even billions - of dollars. Trade secret theft can require companies to lay off employees, to close factories, to lose sales and profits, to experience a decline in competitive position and advantage - or even to go out of business. And this type of crime can have significant impacts not only on our country's economic well-being, but on our national security - allowing hostile states to obtain data and technology that could endanger American lives; expose our energy, financial, or other sensitive sectors to massive losses; or make our infrastructure vulnerable to attack.\", \"In response, the Justice Department has made the investigation and prosecution of trade secret theft a top priority. This is why the National Security Division's Counterespionage Section has taken a leading role in economic espionage cases - and others affecting national security and the export of military and strategic commodities or technology. It's also why, in 2010, I established an internal Task Force on Intellectual Property - led by Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole and other senior Department leaders  - to improve and expand our enforcement efforts in this area. And it's why the FBI has increased its focus on trade secret theft and its use of sophisticated tools and techniques in conducting national security and criminal investigations.\", 'Of course, most trade secret matters are dealt with in civil court. But when the Justice Department receives referrals, we investigate and, when appropriate, prosecute those matters fairly and completely. And, although the primary legislation creating criminal liability for these acts is less than 20 years old, federal law enforcement officials have established a remarkable record of success in this area.', 'In the decade between 2001 and 2011, we secured well over 100 convictions in cases involving criminal trade secret thefts, and 6 convictions in economic espionage cases. For instance, in December 2011, a federal court in Indiana sentenced a man from China to more than 7 years in prison - after his conviction on charges of economic espionage on behalf of a foreign university tied to the Chinese government. Last September - in New Jersey - a jury convicted another Chinese native of trade secret theft and other charges for stealing information from a defense contractor about the performance and guidance systems for missiles and other military hardware. And last November - in Michigan - a former General Motors engineer and her husband were convicted of conspiring to steal more than $40 million worth of trade secrets from GM, with intent to use them in a joint venture with an automotive competitor in China.', \"In these and many other cases - as we've refined our approach and increased our understanding of these crimes and those who commit them - the Department has also gathered valuable intelligence about foreign-based economic espionage. We've forged strong relationships with law enforcement partners, private sector experts, and international allies. And we've begun to raise awareness about the devastating impact of these crimes - and to encourage companies to report suspected breaches to law enforcement - so violators can be caught, brought to justice, and kept from striking again.\", \"As we carry this work into the future - thanks to the support and assistance of everyone here today, and the cutting-edge strategy we're committed to implementing - I'm confident that we'll continue to make great strides in the fight against trade secret theft. We'll keep improving our ability to crack down on intellectual property infringement and economic espionage. And together we'll ensure that the United States is, and always will be, the world leader in innovation.\", \"At this time, it's my privilege to introduce another key leader of this work - Deputy Secretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank - who will provide more information about the Administration's ongoing efforts in this regard.\"]\n",

      "['Five individuals and five corporations have been charged in an indictment unsealed today in Brooklyn, N.Y., for allegedly importing hazardous and counterfeit toys from China for sale in the United States, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer of the Justice Department\\'s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta E. Lynch; Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York James T. Hayes Jr.; Robert E. Perez, New York Field Operations Director of Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Chairman Inez Tenenbaum of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC); and Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly of the New York City Police Department (NYPD).\\n \\nThe 24-count indictment charges Chenglan Hu, 51, Hua Fei Zhang, 52, and Xiu Lan Zhang, 60, all Chinese nationals and residents of Queens, N.Y., and Guan Jun Zhang, 29, and Jun Wu Zhang, 28, both naturalized citizens and Queens residents, along with their closely held companies Family Product USA Inc., H.M. Import USA Corp., ZCY Trading Corp., Zone Import Corp. and ZY Wholesale Inc., with importing and trafficking hazardous toys in violation of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) and toys bearing copyright-infringing images and counterfeit trademarks, smuggling, money laundering and structuring.\\n \\n\"The defendants are accused of importing and selling toys that posed significant health hazards to children or were the product of blatant intellectual property theft,\" said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. \"They allegedly retooled their operations many times in order to avoid detection, and despite repeated citations by the authorities, they continued to peddle counterfeit toys featuring Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants and other popular children\\'s characters.  Today\\'s actions reflect a Justice Department focused on ensuring that consumers receive safe and legitimate goods.\"\\n \\n\"For years, the defendants sought to enrich themselves by importing and selling dangerous and counterfeit children\\'s toys without regard for the law or the health of our children,\" said U.S. Attorney Lynch.  \"Profits from the counterfeit items, as well as toys riddled with lead and choking hazards, went to provide the defendants with luxury cars.  We stand committed to protecting the residents of our communities from those who would engage in such conduct.\"  \\n \\nThe five individual defendants were arrested this morning, and a federal task force comprising HSI agents, other federal agents and NYPD officers, aided by CBP officers and CPSC investigators, executed four search warrants and nine seizure warrants.  The agents, officers and investigators searched the defendants\\' warehouse, two residences and an email account.  In addition, three luxury vehicles, including a Porsche and Lexus, three personal bank accounts and three corporate accounts were seized.  The agents also filed lis pendens on two of the defendants\\' properties in Queens, N.Y.  The defendants\\' initial appearances are scheduled this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ramon E. Reyes Jr. in the Eastern District of New York.\\n \\nThe indictment charges that from July 2005 through January 2013 the individual defendants used their companies, the corporate defendants, to import toys from China that they sold, both wholesale and retail, from a storefront and warehouse in Ridgewood, N.Y., and other locations in Brooklyn and Queens.', 'According to the indictment, the defendants\\' companies had children\\'s toys seized by CBP from shipping containers entering the United States from China on 33 separate occasions.  Seventeen of the 33 seizures were of violative toys - toys prohibited from import into and distribution in the United States, under laws and regulations enforced by the CPSC, because of excessive lead content, excessive phthalate levels, small parts that presented choking, aspiration or ingestion hazards, and easily accessible battery compartments.  Sixteen of the 33 seizures were of toys bearing copyright-infringing images and counterfeit trademarks, including knockoff versions of toys featuring a wide variety of popular children\\'s characters, such as Winnie the Pooh, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants, Betty Boop, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Spiderman, Tweety, Mickey Mouse, Pokemon, as well as those from movies, such as the \"Cars,\" \"Toy Story\" and \"High School Musical.\"', 'The indictment charges that following each of the 33 seizures, the violator toy company was served written notice by CBP detailing the reason for the seizure, and a representative of the company signed a release form acknowledging the seizure and abandoning the seized goods.  Additionally, the violator company and its principal were served written notice by CPSC of the specific safety violations of the toys, and each time a representative of the company signed a release form acknowledging the seizure and abandoning the seized goods. ', 'Due to the number and volume of the seizures, the individual defendants allegedly shifted their use of the companies and alternated formal roles, in order to continue importing and distributing violative and infringing toys.  Each time the number of seizures accumulated for one company, the individual defendants allegedly formed a new toy company to continue importing the violative and infringing toys.', '\"The people and companies involved in this illegal trade not only allegedly infringed on intellectual property rights, they placed the lives of innocent children in danger,\" said HSI Special Agent in Charge Hayes.  \"They allegedly sold toys with high lead content and cheap knock offs with substandard parts that break easily and pose a choking hazard.  HSI is firm on using its unique customs expertise and law enforcement partnerships to put an end to the importation and sale of dangerous goods.\"', '\"Customs and Border Protection is on the forefront of intercepting unsafe, counterfeit products,\" said CBP New York Field Operations Director Perez.  \"We are proud to have done our part preventing these dangerous toys from getting in the hands of our children.\"', '\"Today\\'s action highlights the unprecedented level of cooperation and coordination among federal regulatory and law enforcement partners to keep U.S. consumers safe,\" said CPSC Chairman Tenenbaum.  \"The United States has some of the strongest toy standards and lowest lead limits in the world, and CPSC is committed to enforcing these child safety requirements at the ports and in the marketplace.\"', '\"When it comes to trademark infringement, don\\'t mess with Mickey or other American icons,\" said NYPD Commissioner Kelly.', 'In the indictment, the government is seeking forfeiture of the seized vehicles and bank accounts and the restrained properties, in addition to a money judgment to be determined at trial.', 'The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.', \"The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Evan Williams of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Claire Kedeshian and William Campos of the Eastern District of New York.  This case was jointly investigated by the HSI Intellectual Property Rights Group and the NYPD, through its participation in the New York Border Enforcement Security Taskforce, with the assistance of CPSC and CBP.\", \"The enforcement action announced today is one of many efforts being undertaken by the Department of Justice Task Force on Intellectual Property (IP Task Force).

      "[\"  Good afternoon.   Thank you for having me here today.   I am grateful to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington and to U.S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan, for organizing a conference on this important topic.   Thank you all for taking the time out of your schedules to discuss these issues.   Events like these are critical to helping us succeed in combating cyber threats.\", '  The Threat', '  If there is one thing we all know from the presentations today and our work in the field, it is the seriousness of the cyber threat.   The President has called it \"one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.\"   It\\'s hard to quibble with that.   Hardly a day goes by when cyber events don\\'t show up in the news.   As many of you know, over the last several weeks, financial institutions in the United States have been hit by a series of Distributed Denial of Service (or DDOS) attacks.   Such attacks are relatively easy to carry out, but they can cause serious harm by disrupting companies\\' website services and preventing customer access.   Although these disruptions have been temporary, their frequency and persistence underscores recent Intelligence Community warnings about the \"breadth and sophistication of computer network operations . . . by both state and nonstate actors.\"   The cyber alarm bell has been rung.   The Intelligence Community\\'s most recent Worldwide Threat Assessment confirms that U.S. networks have already been subject to \"extensive illicit intrusions.\"   The head of the National Security Agency and the Pentagon\\'s Cyber Command, for one, believes such intrusions may have resulted in \"the greatest transfer of wealth in history.\"', '  We often think of national security threats, like that of a catastrophic terrorist attack, as questions about prevention.   But the cyber threat is not simply looming - it is here.   It is present and growing.   Although we have not yet experienced a devastating cyber attack along the lines of the \"cyber Pearl Harbor\" that Defense Secretary Panetta recently mentioned - we are already facing the threat of a death by a thousand cuts.   Outside the public eye, a slow hemorrhaging is occurring; a range of cyber activities is incrementally diminishing our security and siphoning off valuable economic assets.   This present-day reality makes the threat of cyber-generated physical attacks, like those that might disrupt the power grid, appear no longer to be the stuff of science fiction.   And all of this comes against the backdrop of sobering forecasts from the highest ranks of our national security community.   FBI Director Mueller - a man not prone to overstatement - predicts that \"the cyber threat will pose the number one threat to our country\" in \"the not too distant future.\"', '  Despite all we know about intrusions against U.S. businesses and government agencies, what is more sobering still is the Intelligence Community\\'s assessment that \"many intrusions . . . are not being detected.\"   Even with respect to those that are detected, identifying who is behind cyber activity can be uniquely challenging.   Technologies can obscure perpetrators\\' identities, wiping away digital footprints or leaving investigative trails that are as long as the web is wide.   Cyber intrusions don\\'t announce themselves or their purpose at the threshold.   Depending on the circumstances, the purpose or endgame of a particular intrusion may be anyone\\'s guess - is it espionage?   Mere mischief?   Theft?   An act of war?   ', '  The threats are as varied as the actors who carry them out.   A growing number of sophisticated state actors have both the desire and the capability to steal sensitive data, trade secrets, and intellectual property for military and competitive advantage.   While most of the state-sponsored intrusions we are aware of remain classified, the onslaught of network intrusions believed to be state-sponsored is widely reported in the media.   We know the Intelligence Community has noted that China and Russia are state actors of \"particular concern,\" and that \"entities within these countries are responsible for extensive illicit intrusions into US computer networks and theft of US intellectual property.\"   Indeed, \"Chinese actors are,\" according to a public report of our top counterintelligence officials, \"the world\\'s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage.\"   And we know that Secretary of Defense Panetta has stated that \"Iran has also undertaken a concerted effort to use cyberspace to its advantage.\"', \"  In cases involving state actors and others, trusted insiders pose particular risks.   Those inside U.S. corporations and agencies may exploit their access to funnel information to foreign nation states.   In these cases, perimeter defense isn't worth much; the enemy is already inside the gates.   The Justice Department has prosecuted a number of corporate insiders and others who obtained trade secrets or technical data from major U.S. companies and routed them to other nations via cyberspace.\", \"  Earlier this year, in the first indictment of foreign state-owned entities for economic espionage, several companies controlled by the government of China were charged in San Francisco for their alleged roles in stealing a proprietary chemical compound developed by a U.S. company for China's benefit.   While this particular theft was not cyber-enabled, cyberspace makes economic espionage that much easier.   In an Internet age, it is no longer necessary to sneak goods out of the country in a suitcase; a single click of a mouse can transmit volumes of data overseas.   Indeed, the Department has secured convictions of individuals who stole corporate trade secrets by simply e-mailing them overseas.   In one recent case, a chemist downloaded a breakthrough chemical process just developed by his company in the United States and e-mailed it to a university in China where he had secretly accepted a new job.\", '  The other major national security threat in cyberspace is cyber-enabled terrorism.   Although we have not yet encountered terrorist organizations using the Internet to launch a full-scale cyber attack against the United States, we believe it is a question of when, not if, they will attempt to do so.   Individuals affiliated with or sympathetic to terrorist organizations are seeking such capabilities. We have already seen terrorists exhorting their followers to engage in cyber attacks on America.   Just this year, an al-Qaeda video released publicly by the Senate Homeland Security Committee encouraged al-Qaeda followers to engage in \"electronic jihad\" by carrying out cyber attacks against the West.', '  Terrorists have already begun using cyberspace to facilitate bomb plots and other operations.   These activities go beyond the use of cyberspace to spread propaganda and recruit followers.   For example, the individuals who planned the attempted Times Square bombing in May 2010 used public web cameras for reconnaissance, file sharing sites to share operational details, and remote conferencing software to communicate.   Najibullah Zazi attempted to carry out suicide bomb attacks against the New York subways around the anniversary of 9/11 three years ago.   After returning to the United States from terrorist travel, he used the Internet to access the bomb-making instructions he had received in Pakistan and tried to communicate via the Internet in code with his al-Qaeda handlers in Pakistan just prior to the planned attack.   Khalid Aldawsari, who was convicted in June of this year in the Northern District of Texas, used the Internet extensively to research U.S. targets and to purchase chemicals and other bomb-making materials.', ' ', '  Evolving To Meet the Threat -- Learning from the Counterterrorism Model', \"  The threats we face in cyberspace are changing, and we must change with them.   Of course, we have faced similar challenges before.   After the devastating attacks eleven years ago, we learned some hard lessons.   We have since put those lessons into practice:   working across agencies to share information, and bringing down legal, structural, and cultural barriers.   Law enforcement's approach to terrorism has become intelligence-led and threat-driven.   We have erected new structures, including the National Security Division, which I am privileged to lead.   As the first new litigating division at the Justice Department in nearly fifty years, the National Security Division was created to bring together intelligence lawyers and operators on the one hand, and prosecutors and law enforcement agents on the other, to focus all talent on the threats before us.   \", '  Since September 11, we have made great progress against terrorism by developing effective partnerships that help us identify threats and choose the best tools available to disrupt them.   Much of our success is attributable to the all-hands-on-deck approach we have adopted for countering terrorism.   From where I sit, I can see this change reflected in our day-to-day operations.   In our investigations, for instance, we actively seek to preserve the ability to prosecute even while using intelligence tools and vice versa.   We must bring the same approach, a whole-of-government approach, an all-tools approach, to combat cyber threats to our national security.   Investigations and prosecutions will be critical tools for deterrence and disruption, ones that we have a responsibility to use.   But they are not the only options available.   The diversity of cyber threats and cyber threat actors demands a diverse response.   This nation has many tools - intelligence, law enforcement, military, diplomatic, and economic - at its collective disposal as well as deep, and diverse, expertise.   The trick is in harnessing our collective resources to work effectively together.', '  Those of us charged with investigating and disrupting cyber threats to national security and advising operators and agents must be creative and forward-looking in our approach.   First, we must consider - in conjunction with our partners - what cyber threats will look like in the coming years.   Only by knowing what is on the horizon can we ensure that the right tools exist to address cyber threats before they materialize.   Second, we must be vigilant to prevent the formation of what the WMD Commission after 9/11 called \"legal myths\" that have led to \"uncertainty\" in the past \"about real legal prohibitions\" among operators.   And, together with operators, we must consider what kinds of tools, investigations, and outreach we can launch now to lay the groundwork for future cyber efforts.   These may be relatively simple things, like standardized protocols and established points of contact to make reporting intrusions easier.   Or they may take the form of institutional relationships between the government and the private sector for sharing information.   ', '  On an operational level, both public and private sector attorneys need to be able to tell clients what options they have available to deal with cyber threats.   If cyberspace is an \"information super-highway,\" then lawyers are the GPS system in a client\\'s car:   It is our job to tell the client how to get there.   When obstacles get in the way, we should tell the client how to avoid them.   We must look ahead, anticipate jams, and route clients around them.   ', '  This metaphor is particularly applicable in the cyber realm.   As cyber events unfold in real time, we learn more about our adversary, the means available to him or her, and the vulnerabilities in our own systems.   Our advice must adapt accordingly.   For those of us in government who act as operational lawyers, it is important in this environment to be clear about where the legal debate stops and the policy debate begins.   For those of you in the private sector, I imagine one concern is that your clients not be left vulnerable in a shifting legal landscape.   And for those of you in academia, we need your help testing boundaries and pushing forward with questions that need to be asked and answered by all of us as we navigate this legal space together.   ', '  One of the significant operational challenges we face is the same one the Intelligence Community confronted in reorganizing itself after the attacks of September 11.   The cyber threat demands ready and fluid means of sharing information and coordinating our actions.   At the National Security Division, we have made this evolution, and combating this threat, a top priority.   Working with our partners - including the FBI, the U.S. Attorney community, and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (one of their leaders, Richard Downing is here today) - we are ensuring that all resources are brought to bear against national security cyber threats.   ', \"  To help accomplish these goals, the National Security Division established earlier this year a National Security Cyber Specialists' Network to serve as a one-stop shop in the Justice Department for national security-related cyber matters.   The network brings together experts from across the National Security Division and the Criminal Division and serves as a centralized resource for the private sector, prosecutors, and agents around the country when they learn of national security-related computer intrusions.   Each U.S. Attorney's office around the country has designated a point of contact for the network.   These skilled Assistant U.S. Attorneys will act as force multipliers, broadening the network's reach and ensuring a link back to their counterparts at headquarters.   Drawing upon the Joint Terrorism Task Force model, which has been successful in the terrorism realm, the network seeks to improve the flow of national security cyber information to offices throughout the country.   This means more information, earlier on, in national security cyber incidents.   Thanks to the contribution of other parts of the Department, especially CCIPS, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney's offices, the network has helped us to focus nationwide on bringing more national security cyber investigations.   Through this nationwide network, we are consolidating and deepening the Department's expertise, institutionalizing information sharing, ensuring coordination, and pursuing investigations.\", \"  We have also trained our attention on the diverse cyber capabilities that reside throughout the government.   The U.S. Secret Service, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Defense, not to mention the FBI, are all common partners in this fight, each using their distinct tools to achieve a common goal.   We have enhanced our joint work with the FBI's National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, where we now have a dedicated National Security Division liaison.   \", \"  Within DOJ, we are putting more prosecutors against the threat and focusing on how to best equip and educate our cyber cadre.   Through the National Security Cyber Specialists' Network, we are training prosecutors around the country.   Next month, more than 100 prosecutors will gather in Washington, D.C. to share expertise on everything from digital evidence to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   No matter who the perpetrator is, being an effective adviser today requires an understanding of the technologies at hand.   Perhaps we should all take a page from Estonia--where I understand they're beginning a system of teaching first graders how to program!   As courts confront these technologies, we also have a role in helping them grapple with what these changes mean for the development of the law and interpretations of existing legal authorities.\", '  Partnership with the Private Sector ', '  Of course, the need for collaboration does not end there.   While interaction with the private sector is something that does not always come easily to the national security community, which is accustomed to operating in secrecy, it is absolutely necessary here.   The Intelligence Community has noted the considerable portion of U.S. companies that report they have been the victims of cybersecurity breaches as well as the increased volume of malware on U.S. networks.   Private companies are on the front lines.   Individual defenses, as well as broader efforts to reform - like the legislation proposed by the Administration last year - will require our joint efforts.', '  To succeed in these efforts, we must develop a greater understanding of the concerns and pressures under which our private sector partners operate.   A home computer user, whose machine is used in a botnet attack might not have much incentive to remove or check for malware.   But a company targeted by such an attack has considerable incentive to do so.   When dealing with corporate victims, the government must understand the competing interests at play.   Companies may have shareholders, reputational concerns, and sometimes legal limitations.   Yet we cannot fight the current or the future threat with old mindsets on either side.   My colleague, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, has spoken compellingly about the need for a \"culture of security\" and a \"culture of disclosure\" in industry.   For our part, we need to understand the private sector\\'s concerns; we need to understand that it is not just the red tape of government that industry fears.   They also fear that the disclosure of computer intrusions will bring yellow tape as well - that it will disrupt business by converting the corporate suite into a crime scene.   Reporting breaches and thefts of information is the first step toward preventing future harm.   For our part, we will work with industry.   We will share information where we can and use protective orders and other tools to protect confidential and proprietary information.   ', '  Conclusion', '  How we respond to cyber intrusions and attacks, and how we organize and equip ourselves going forward, will have lasting effects on our government and its relationship with the private sector.   Particularly in these early moments, in what will no doubt be a sustained endeavor, it is incumbent upon us to take notes - to identify impediments, legal questions, technical challenges, and address them together.   All the while we must bear in mind the great potential of these technologies and the importance of not stifling them as we find better ways to make them secure.', \"  We have heard the warnings about the potential for a cyber 9/11, but we are, for the moment, in a position to do something to prevent it.   The cyber threat poses the next test of the imperative that we see law enforcement and national security as joint endeavors.   Our work offers an opportunity to demonstrate the strength and adaptability of the lessons we have learned over the last eleven years in the fight against terrorism.   U.S. Attorney's Offices - and all of you sitting in this room - are at the forefront of these issues.   I look forward to pursuing the threats we face in partnership.

      "[\"Thank you, Jim, for that kind introduction, and for your commitment to protecting the rights, safety, and best interests of American consumers, innovators, and entrepreneurs. It's a pleasure to be here at Towson University, and a privilege to join with so many dedicated leaders - including United States Attorneys Rod Rosenstein, Neil MacBride, and Ron Machen - as we announce the recipients of the Fiscal Year 2012 Intellectual Property Theft Enforcement Program grant awards.\", \"These new investments represent an important step forward in our fight to prevent and combat IP crimes; and they will enable some of our key state and local partners to build on the record of success that Jim just discussed. As part of these grants, we are awarding more than $2.4 million to 13 law enforcement agencies across the country - including the County of Baltimore, which will be receiving nearly $124,000 to enhance its Police Department's IP-enforcement training and investigative efforts. Award grants also will be provided to:\", '*          City of Austin, Texas', '*          City of Central Point, Oregon', '*          City of Orlando, Florida', '*          City of San Antonio, Texas', \"*          Cook County Sherriff's Office, Illinois\", \"*          County of Riverside District Attorney's Office, California\", '*          County of Sacramento, California', '*          California Department of Justice', \"*          Los Angeles City Attorney's Office\", \"*          New York County District Attorney's Office\", '*          St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department', '*          Virginia State Police', 'Although these awards will be utilized in a variety of ways, they will help to achieve our common goals: to advance prosecutions - as well as prevention and education activities - related to IP theft . These resources will be used to fund new police department positions specifically tasked with investigating IP crime; to create Spanish-speaking radio messages about the dangers of IP theft; to purchase cutting-edge surveillance, evidence collection, and storage equipment; to develop and implement more law enforcement and prosecutor training programs; and to improve coordination, information sharing, and data collection.', \"Without question, these new investments are coming at a critical time. As our country continues to recover from once-in-a-generation economic challenges, the need to defend IP rights - and to protect Americans from IP theft - has never been more urgent. We have seen - far too often - that IP crimes are not victimless. Not only can they devastate individual lives and legitimate businesses, they also undermine our nation's financial stability, can jeopardize the health of our citizens, and even threaten our national security.\", \"But make no mistake, today's Justice Department is fighting back. And thanks to Jim's leadership of the IP Task Force; the engagement of partners from across law enforcement and the public and private sectors; and the outstanding work of the Department's U.S. Attorneys' Offices, Criminal and Civil Divisions, and Office of Justice Programs - our efforts to prevent and combat IP crimes have never been stronger.\", \"Over the last two years, in addition to the work of the Task Force, the Department has played a leading role in the implementation of the first-ever government-wide Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement, which was released in June of 2010 and is being overseen by the Office of the U.S. IP Enforcement Coordinator. We've also taken steps to ensure that the Department has the ability - and expertise - necessary to take our IP theft prevention efforts to a new level.\", 'I\\'m proud to report that we now have 40 prosecutors and four computer forensics experts serving in the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section; 25 Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property - or, \"CHIP\" units - in our U.S. Attorney\\'s offices; m ore than 260 specially-trained CHIP prosecutors ; m ore than 50 FBI IP Special Agents; a robust international IP program; and strong partnerships with a broad range of IP rights holders.', 'These capacity-building efforts are paying dividends. In this year alone, we have prosecuted a number of significant IP cases. For example, in January - in one of the largest criminal copyright cases in U.S. history - the Department indicted two corporations and seven individuals with operating an international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of numerous types of copyrighted works, through Megaupload.com and other related sites.', \"In March, in one of the largest counterfeit goods cases in U.S. history, federal law enforcement agencies disrupted massive conspiracies to import more than $300 million in counterfeit goods from China, and illegal drugs from Taiwan, to the United States.  And we've continued to work with ICE-HSI and the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center on a number of matters, including Operation In Our Sites - which has facilitated the seizure of dozens of domain names associated with businesses engaged in online piracy and counterfeiting.\", \"We also have enhanced our investigations and prosecutions of corporate and state-sponsored economic espionage. And, because IP crime is global in nature, I've prioritized increasing our international engagement. In fact, to date, Department officials have trained, educated, and met with thousands of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators, and policymakers from more than 100 countries on IP protection. I personally have traveled to China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Brazil, Hungary, and Germany to meet with my counterparts - as well as other government and industry leaders - to emphasize the importance of combating IP crime on a global scale, and with a global strategy.\", \"But, as much as we've accomplished in recent years, we've also learned that the Justice Department can't win this fight - and keep pace with today's IP criminals - alone. We need your help. We need the assistance of industry leaders, law enforcement officials, and IP crime victims. And we will continue to rely on the leadership and engagement of each one of this year's grant awardees.\", \"Only by working together will we be able to anticipate, understand, and overcome the new methods and technologies being employed by those who seek to profit from the innovations of others. That's why, in the fight against IP crime, the Justice Department is - and will remain - committed to bringing our full enforcement resources to bear, and to increasing collaboration with our state, local, international, industry, and community partners.\", \"Together, I know we can build on the momentum that's been established. And I look forward to all that each of you - and, especially, this year's award recipients - will help to accomplish in the days ahead.\", \"And, now, I'd like to turn things over to a key leader in this work, who is helping to make historic progress here in Maryland - United States Attorney Rod Rosenstein.\"]\n",

      "[\"      Thank you, Barb, for that kind introduction.  Good afternoon.  I am very pleased to be here today with the State of Michigan  '    s chief executives for information, technology and security, as well as leaders in industry, government and academia who are creating the technology that is powering America in the 21  st   Century.    \", '      Now more than ever, innovations in technology and manufacturing are key to American prosperity and Michigan has long been at the forefront of design, engineering and manufacturing.  We at the U.S. Department of Justice, want to do all that we can to protect American businesses against criminals who seek to steal and illegally profit from your creativity and innovation.    ', '      American companies make some of the most sought after products in the world.  Consumers benefit from having ready access to the most cutting-edge, high quality products available; and it helps to create jobs and strengthen our economy.  At the same time, this also makes our companies an ideal target of intellectual property crime.  ', \"      While imitation may be the highest form of flattery, American industry isn't looking to be flattered by thieves engaged in illicit competition.  Industry seeks a fair and level marketplace where American innovation can thrive.    \", '      Rather than take the time to research and develop their own ideas, all too often competitors, and even some foreign state actors, seek to steal proprietary designs, systems, processes, and formulas from American manufacturers, who invested years and millions of dollars into the research and development that it takes to create smarter cars, better computer technologies and more sophisticated military equipment.    ', \"      Ironically, new technology itself has made it easier than ever to steal trade secrets.  A well-placed rogue employee can capture a company  '    s highly-protected crown jewels   -     on which its profits and jobs depend -- on no more than a thumb drive and instantly transmit it to a foreign competitor from their home computer.    \", '      Not only are we seeing the theft of trade secrets, but we are increasingly seeing counterfeit auto and military parts. Counterfeit parts endanger consumers, put our troops at risk and undermine our national security.  They erode profits for American manufacturers, and they can cost hard-working Americans their jobs.  A recent report by the Senate Armed Services Committee found the problem of counterfeit military parts to be widespread in the defense supply chain, finding 1,800 cases of suspected counterfeit parts over a two-year period, including parts for Navy helicopters, military cargo planes, and anti-submarine aircraft.  Among the counterfeit parts were electronic components that help pilots avoid hazards and identify targets at night, as well as an ice detection module critical for the safe operation of certain military planes.  In one instance, a part literally fell out of its socket and was found rattling around inside the module.  Not only do these substandard parts risk the safety of our service men and women, they also drive up the cost of maintaining military equipment.  The cost to fix computers or helicopters or planes that contain counterfeit parts has cost American taxpayers millions of dollars.    ', \"      These are just some of the reasons why Attorney General Holder has made protecting intellectual property one of the Department  '    s top priorities.  As Deputy Attorney General, one of my duties is to serve as the chair of the Department  '    s Task Force on Intellectual Property.  The Attorney General recognized that the rise in intellectual property crime in the United States and abroad threatens not only our public safety but also our economic well being.  Because of this, he created the Department  '    s Task Force to confront this threat with a strong and coordinated response.  Task Force members include senior representatives from the office of the Attorney General, Office of the Associate Attorney General, Criminal Division, Civil Division, Antitrust Division, Office of Justice Programs, Executive Office of United States Attorneys, Attorney General  '    s Advisory Committee, Office of Legal Policy and the FBI. Through the coordination of the efforts of Task Force members, we can identify and implement a multi-faceted strategy with our federal, state and international partners to effectively combat this type of crime.    \", \"      The Task Force monitors and coordinates overall intellectual property enforcement efforts at the Department, with an increased focus on the international aspects of IP enforcement, including the links between IP crime and international organized crime.  In particular, our Task Force mission is focused on four areas. These include: (1) monitoring and coordinating the Department  '    s overall IP enforcement efforts; (2) increasing the focus on international IP enforcement; (3) prioritizing efforts to develop evidence of the link between IP crime and international organized crime; and (4) expanding civil efforts through both policy/legislative development and increased enforcement.  \", '      In addition, the Task Force four topical areas of focus have been:  (1) Health and Safety; (2) Theft of Trade Secrets and Economic Espionage; (3) Large-Scale Piracy and Counterfeiting; and (4) links to Organized Criminal Networks.  As a result, our enforcement efforts at the Department are more vigorous, more strategic, more collaborative, and more effective than ever before.  ', '      The Department has also increased its resources so that we currently have in our arsenal:  ', '      Why are we dedicating so many resources to this area?  Because it is clear to us at the Department of Justice:  IP crimes are anything but victimless.  For far too long, the sale of counterfeit, defective, and dangerous goods had been accepted as \"business as usual.\"  But these and other IP crimes can destroy jobs, harm our economy, suppress innovation, and jeopardize the health and safety of consumers.  These activities also fund dangerous - and even violent - criminal enterprises and organized crime networks.  That is why, through the IP Task Force, it is our mission and our commitment, to protect our nation\\'s economic and national security as effectively as possible.  ', '      Perhaps our most effective and primary tool is vigorous criminal prosecution.  Let me tell you about just a few from the last few months:    ', '      In August, a former Bridgestone research scientist was charged with eight counts of theft of trade secrets and seven counts of making false statements to federal agents.  The Bridgestone facility in Akron, Ohio, where the defendant had been employed, was responsible for conducting research and development for various product lines, including tire, rubber, and other polymer-related products.  The trial is scheduled for this month.  ', '      Last Spring, in New Jersey, the Department charged 29 defendants for their alleged roles in massive, international conspiracies to import hundreds of millions of dollars in counterfeit goods from China.  On a single day, 20 coordinated arrests were made in four U.S. states and the Philippines.    ', '      The Department also continues to work with the Department of Homeland Security on Operation in Our Sites, an ongoing, multi-year law enforcement initiative that targets businesses engaged in online counterfeiting and piracy and is designed to disrupt infringing sites and to educate and protect consumers.  Through Operation in Our Sites the Department and law enforcement has seized over 839 domain names and replaced them with a law enforcement banner which has been viewed over 103 million times.    ', '      In January, the Department unsealed an indictment against seven individuals and two corporations for running an organized criminal enterprise engaged in massive online piracy, through the website MegaUpload.com and other sites.  Megaupload is alleged to have generated $175 million in criminal proceeds and caused over $500M in harm to copyright owners; and they boasted being responsible for 4 % of all traffic on the Internet.  ', '      And of course, through the efforts of the talented prosecutors in the USAO here in Michigan, we have achieved numerous significant successes prosecuting intellectual property and computer crimes.    ', '      For example, a former employee of Ford Motor Company, headquartered in Dearborn, was sentenced to six years in prison for stealing trade secrets to benefit a Chinese competitor.  Before leaving his job at Ford to work for a Chinese company, the defendant copied more than 4,000 documents onto an external hard drive, including sensitive design documents pertaining to electrical systems, which he took with him to China.    ', '      In another case, employees of Metaldyne Corporation, headquartered in Plymouth were convicted and sentenced to prison for conspiracy to steal proprietary information to assist a Chinese competitor.  The proprietary information involved the manufacturing process for powdered metal parts.    ', '      In a third case, owners of an auto parts supplier in Chesterfield Township were convicted for their roles in a scheme to substitute cheap, substandard materials for use in seat belt assemblies, putting consumers at risk.    ', '      In a pending case, a husband and wife have been charged with conspiracy to possess trade secrets from General Motors.  The indictment alleges that one of the defendants, while employed by General Motors, provided GM trade secret information relating to hybrid vehicles to her husband for the benefit of a foreign competitor.  The trial in that case is set for next month.  ', '      These actions are just a few illustrations of our vigorous efforts to enforcement intellectual property laws here in Michigan and throughout the United States.  And they send a message to would-be offenders that we will aggressively pursue those who would commit these offenses.  ', \"      Although the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice have done much to protect our nation's intellectual property, I recognize that there is more work to be done.    \", '      As our nation continues to recover from once-in-a-generation economic challenges, safeguarding intellectual property rights - and protecting American innovators and entrepreneurs and the jobs they create - has never been more important.  And as technology makes it easier for criminals to intrude into our computers, copy our designs, and steal our intellectual property, we are committed to doing all we can to stay one step ahead to protect American innovation.    ', '      It is important that we in government, academia and the private sector work together in this effort.    ', \"      There's no question that the Justice Department's efforts - and this Administration's dedication - to combating IP crimes has never been stronger.  But I also recognize that government can't win this fight - and keep pace with today's IP criminals - alone.    \", \"      We all have a part to play.  We, at the Department, must continue to serve as your partner in identifying, investigating and prosecuting these criminals.  We're seeking new ways to share information - and to leverage expertise - with a variety of private sector partners, as well as government and law enforcement officials across the country.  Industry has an important role in serving as the first line of defense.  We know some of the tactics that are frequently used - for instance, we know that trade secrets can be stolen by aggressive targeting and recruiting of insiders working for U.S. companies and research institutions; and we know that our IP is at risk, from foreign competitors, foreign state actors, and criminal organizations who conduct economic intelligence through operations involving bribery, cyber intrusions, theft, dumpster diving in search of discarded intellectual property or prototypes, and wiretapping.  \", '      The best way to avoid theft is for companies, start-ups, academic institutions, and anyone possessing valuable intellectual property to take some basic steps to protect their trade secrets.  Make sure you have systems installed to prevent someone from hacking into your IT systems and stealing your intellectual property.  Make sure access to your most valuable IP is restricted to only those employees that need to have such access.  Make sure you use encryption in sending electronic files within and outside the company.  And make sure to regularly change password access to your computers on a regular basis.    ', '      These are easy, yet effective measures to take to begin to solve this problem.  And, importantly, if you have any concerns that your IP has been compromised, let us know right away.  The earlier we get involved, the more we can do to help you.  ', \"      The fact is that we'll never be able to prosecute our way out of this problem, or meet our goals and significant responsibilities on our own, separately.  It's only by working together - a partnership with the Department of Justice and our partner agencies; industry leaders and security experts, like you, in this room; law enforcement officials at every level; and with international allies, IP crime victims, and members of the public - that we can anticipate, understand, and overcome the new methods and technologies being employed by those who seek to profit from the innovations of others.  \", \"      We appreciate opportunities like today to share ideas with each other to help us in our common mission.  Thank you for all you do to create Michigan's technology, and we at the Department will continue to do all in our power - working with you and for you - to continue protecting it.    \"]\n",

      "[\"  BRIDGEPORT, Conn. - Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (PWC), a Canadian subsidiary of the Connecticut-based defense contractor United Technologies Corporation (UTC), today pleaded guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act and making false statements in connection with its illegal export to China of U.S.-origin military software used in the development of China's first modern military attack helicopter, the Z-10.\", \"  In addition, UTC, its U.S.-based subsidiary Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation (HSC) and PWC have all agreed to pay more than $75 million as part of a global settlement with the Justice Department and State Department in connection with the China arms export violations and for making false and belated disclosures to the U.S. government about these illegal exports.  Roughly $20.7 million of this sum is to be paid to the Justice Department.  The remaining $55 million is payable to the State Department as part of a separate consent agreement to resolve outstanding export issues, including those related to the Z-10.  Up to $20 million of this penalty can be suspended if applied by UTC to remedial compliance measures.  As part of the settlement, the companies admitted conduct set forth in a stipulated and publicly filed statement of facts.   Today's actions were announced by David B. Fein, U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut; Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; John Morton, Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); Ed Bradley, Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS); Kimberly K. Mertz, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI New Haven Division; David Mills, Department of Commerce Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement; and Andrew J. Shapiro, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs.\", '  The Charges', '  Today in the District of Connecticut, the Justice Department filed a three-count criminal information charging UTC, PWC and HSC.  Count One charges PWC with violating the Arms Export Control Act in connection with the illegal export of defense articles to China for the Z-10 helicopter.  Count Two charges PWC, UTC and HSC with making false statements to the U.S. government in their belated disclosures relating to the illegal exports.  Count Three charges PWC and HSC with failure to timely inform the U.S. government of exports of defense articles to China.', '  While PWC has pleaded guilty to Counts One and Two, the Justice Department has recommended that prosecution of UTC and HSC on Count Two, and PWC and HSC on Count Three be deferred for two years, provided the companies abide by the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department.  As part of the agreement, the companies must pay $75 million and retain an Independent Monitor to monitor and assess their compliance with export laws for the next two years.', '  The Export Scheme', \"  Since 1989, the United States has imposed a prohibition upon the export to China of all U.S. defense articles and associated technical data as a result of the conduct in June 1989 at Tiananmen Square by the military of the People's Republic of China.  In February 1990, the U.S. Congress imposed a prohibition upon licenses or approvals for the export of defense articles to the People's Republic of China.  In codifying the embargo, Congress specifically named helicopters for inclusion in the ban.\", \"  Dating back to the 1980s, China sought to develop a military attack helicopter.  Beginning in the 1990s, after Congress had imposed the prohibition on exports to China, China sought to develop its attack helicopter under the guise of a civilian medium helicopter program in order to secure Western assistance.  The Z-10, developed with assistance from Western suppliers, is China's first modern military attack helicopter.\", '  During the development phases of China\\'s Z-10 program, each Z-10 helicopter was powered by engines supplied by PWC.  PWC delivered 10 of these development engines to China in 2001 and 2002.  Despite the military nature of the Z-10 helicopter, PWC determined on its own that these development engines for the Z-10 did not constitute \"defense articles,\" requiring a U.S. export license, because they were identical to those engines PWC was already supplying China for a commercial helicopter. ', '  Because the Electronic Engine Control software, made by HSC in the United States to test and operate the PWC engines, was modified for a military helicopter application, it was a defense article and required a U.S. export license.  Still, PWC knowingly and willfully caused this software to be exported to China for the Z-10 without any U.S. export license.  In 2002 and 2003, PWC caused six versions of the military software to be illegally exported from HSC in the United States to PWC in Canada, and then to China, where it was used in the PWC engines for the Z-10. ', '  According to court documents, PWC knew from the start of the Z-10 project in 2000 that the Chinese were developing an attack helicopter and that supplying it with U.S.-origin components would be illegal.  When the Chinese claimed that a civil version of the helicopter would be developed in parallel, PWC marketing personnel expressed skepticism internally about the \"sudden appearance\" of the civil program, the timing of which they questioned as \"real or imagined.\"  PWC nevertheless saw an opening for PWC \"to insist on exclusivity in [the] civil version of this helicopter,\" and stated that the Chinese would \"no longer make reference to the military program.\" PWC failed to notify UTC or HSC about the attack helicopter until years later and purposely turned a blind eye to the helicopter\\'s military application. ', '  HSC in the United States had believed it was providing its software to PWC for a civilian helicopter in China, based on claims from PWC.  By early 2004, HSC learned there might an export problem and stopped working on the Z-10 project.  UTC also began to ask PWC about the exports to China for the Z-10.  Regardless, PWC on its own modified the software and continued to export it to China through June 2005.', \"  According to court documents, PWC's illegal conduct was driven by profit.  PWC anticipated that its work on the Z-10 military attack helicopter in China would open the door to a far more lucrative civilian helicopter market in China, which according to PWC estimates, was potentially worth as much as $2 billion to PWC. \", '  Belated and False Disclosures to U.S. Government', \"  These companies failed to disclose to the U.S. government the illegal exports to China for several years and only did so after an investor group queried UTC in early 2006 about whether PWC's role in China's Z-10 attack helicopter might violate U.S. laws.  The companies then made an initial disclosure to the State Department in July 2006, with follow-up submissions in August and September 2006. \", \"  The 2006 disclosures contained numerous false statements.  Among other things, the companies falsely asserted that they were unaware until 2003 or 2004 that the Z-10 program involved a military helicopter.  In fact, by the time of the disclosures, all three companies were aware that PWC officials knew at the project's inception in 2000 that the Z-10 program involved an attack helicopter. \", '  Today, the Z-10 helicopter is in production and initial batches were delivered to the People\\'s Liberation Army of China in 2009 and 2010.  The primary mission of the Z-10 is anti-armor and battlefield interdiction.  Weapons of the Z-10 have included 30 mm cannons, anti-tank guided missiles, air-to-air missiles and unguided rockets. \"PWC exported controlled U.S. technology to China, knowing it would be used in the development of a military attack helicopter in violation of the U.S. arms embargo with China,\" said U.S. Attorney Fein.  \"PWC took what it described internally as a \\'calculated risk,\\' because it wanted to become the exclusive supplier for a civil helicopter market in China with projected revenues of up to two billion dollars.  Several years after the violations were known, UTC, HSC and PWC disclosed the violations to the government and made false statements in doing so.  The guilty pleas by PWC and the agreement reached with all three companies should send a clear message that any corporation that willfully sends export controlled material to an embargoed nation will be prosecuted and punished, as will those who know about it and fail to make a timely and truthful disclosure.\"', '  \"Due in part to the efforts of these companies, China was able to develop its first modern military attack helicopter with restricted U.S. defense technology.  As today\\'s case demonstrates, the Justice Department will spare no effort to hold accountable those who compromise U.S. national security for the sake of profits and then lie about it to the government,\" said Assistant Attorney General Monaco.  \"I thank the agents, analysts and prosecutors who helped bring about this important case.\"', '  \"This case is a clear example of how the illegal export of sensitive technology reduces the advantages our military currently possesses,\" said ICE Director Morton.  \"I am hopeful that the conviction of Pratt & Whitney Canada and the substantial penalty levied against United Technologies and its subsidiaries will deter other companies from considering similarly ill-conceived business practices in the future.  American military prowess depends on lawful, controlled exports of sensitive technology by U.S. industries and their subsidiaries, which is why ICE will continue its present campaign to aggressively investigate and prosecute criminal violations of U.S. export laws relating to national security.\"', '  \"Today\\'s charges and settlement demonstrate the continued commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and fellow agencies to protect sensitive U.S. defense technology from being illegally exported,\" said DCIS Special Agent in Charge Bradley.  \"Safeguarding our military technology is vital to our nation\\'s defense and the protection of our war fighters both home and abroad.  We know that foreign governments are actively seeking U.S. defense technology for their own development.  Thwarting these efforts is a top priority for DCIS.  I applaud the agents and prosecutors who worked tirelessly to bring about this result.\"', '  \"Preventing the loss of critical U.S. information and technologies is one of the most important investigative priorities of the FBI,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Mertz.  \"Our adversaries routinely target sensitive research and development data and intellectual property from universities, government agencies, manufacturers, and defense contractors.  While the thefts associated with economic espionage and illegal technology transfers may not capture the same level of attention as a terrorist incident, the costs to the U.S. economy and our national security are substantial.  Violations of the Arms Export Control Act put our nation at risk and the FBI, along with all of our federal agency partners, are committed to ensuring that embargoed technologies do not fall into the wrong hands.  Those who violate these laws should expect to be held accountable.  An important part of the FBI\\'s strategy in this area involves the development of strategic partnerships.  In that regard, the FBI looks forward to future coordination with UTC and its subsidiaries to strengthen information sharing and counterintelligence awareness.\"', '  \"Protecting national security is our top priority,\" said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Mills.  \"Today\\'s action sends a clear signal that federal law enforcement agencies will work together diligently to prevent U.S. technology from falling into the wrong hands.\"', '  Assistant Secretary Shapiro, of the State Department\\'s Bureau of Political and Military Affairs, said, \"Today\\'s $75 million settlement with United Technologies Corporation sends a clear message:  willful violators of U.S. arms export control regulations will be pursued and punished.  The successful resolution of this case is the byproduct of the tireless work of our compliance officers and highlights the relentless commitment of the State Department to protect sensitive American technologies from being illegally transferred.\"', \"  U.S. Attorney Fein commended the many agencies involved in this investigation, including ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New Haven; the DCIS in New Haven; the New Haven Division of the FBI; the Department of Commerce's Boston Office of Export Enforcement.  He also praised the Office of the HSI Attache in Toronto, which was essential to the initiation and investigation of this matter, and the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, for its critical role in the global resolution of this matter.\", \"  The prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephen B. Reynolds and Michael J. Gustafson from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut, with assistance from Steven Pelak and Ryan Fayhee of the Counterespionage Section of the Justice Department's National Security Division.\"]\n"

      "[\"  WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice has seized more than $1.5 million in proceeds from the distribution of counterfeit sports apparel and jerseys as the result of an investigation into the sale of counterfeit goods on commercial websites, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald C. Machen Jr. and John Morton, Director of the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\", \"  The investigation also resulted in the seizure of three domain names used in the sale of counterfeit sports apparel.  The funds were seized from interbank accounts and six money service business accounts.  The seizure warrants were unsealed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia on May 7, 2012. The developments are the latest result of Operation In Our Sites, a law enforcement initiative targeting online commercial intellectual property crime announced by ICE's Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in June 2010.  Operation In Our Sites targeted online retailers of a diverse array of counterfeit goods, including sports equipment, shoes, handbags, athletic apparel, sunglasses and DVD boxed sets.

      "['       Mr. President, Madame Attorney General, Madame Minister, Mr. Secretary General, distinguished attorneys general and guests.', \"   It is a distinct pleasure to be in Mexico City at today's Hemispheric Meeting and to have the unique opportunity to speak with you - our shared partners in the Americas and Spain - about transnational organized crime, undoubtedly a global menace that we must work together to defeat.  Organized criminals have adapted rapidly to the new, globalized world.  They are, in fact, helping to shape that world, and not in a good direction.  Our peoples, our governments, must prove equally adaptable if we are to prevail.      The steps that the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. government as a whole, and our partners around the world are taking to address the threat cannot be overstated.\", '       For many decades the fight against organized crime has been one of the highest enforcement priorities of the Department of Justice.  Many dedicated agents and prosecutors over the past 80 years have devoted their careers to the battle against the families of La Cosa Nostra, Italian-American crime groups that at one time existed in most major cities in the United States.  More recently, agents and prosecutors have brought an equal level of dedication to the fight against the narco-trafficking cartels, who have been and remain some of the most sophisticated and dangerous transnational organized crime groups in the world.  ', '       But even as we continue to vigorously investigate and prosecute these criminal groups, we are aware that the landscape of organized crime has been shifting.  The advance of globalization and the internet, while hugely beneficial to people everywhere, has also created unparalleled opportunities for criminals to expand their operations and use the facilities of global communication and commerce to carry out their criminal activities across national borders. ', '       In December 2010 the United States government completed a comprehensive review of international crime.  That review concluded that in the previous 15 years transnational criminal networks have forged new and powerful alliances among themselves and with powerful figures in business and government, and that they are engaged in an unprecedented range of illicit activities that are destabilizing to nations and populations around the globe.  ', '       Our review noted that the new transnational organized crime groups pose special challenges to law enforcement.  For example, some countries undergoing the transition from authoritarian rule often serve as fertile breeding grounds for organized crime.  These countries face serious organized crime challenges that will stifle not only their own economic development, but will also have global implications in our increasingly interconnected world.  ', '       Organized crime groups in the past often featured rigid lines of authority and closed ', '       memberships.  This not only imposed a level of discipline, but it also made them easier to define and combat.  The newer organizations often consist of loose networks of individuals or groups that may cooperate on an ad hoc basis to share expertise, skills and resources, while still operating independently and transcending national boundaries.  This allows criminals to more easily evade law enforcement and to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.  The decentralized nature of their operations also means that law enforcement can no longer cripple the network by arresting a few key leaders.  ', '       Because of the sophistication of the world economy, organized crime groups have developed an ability to exploit legitimate actors and their skills in order to further the criminal enterprises.  For example, transnational organized criminal groups often rely on lawyers to facilitate illicit transactions.  These lawyers create shell companies, open offshore bank accounts in the names of those shell companies, and launder criminal proceeds through trust accounts.  Other lawyers working for organized crime figures bring frivolous libel cases against individuals who expose their criminal activities.  Business owners and bankers are enlisted to launder money, and employees of legitimate companies are used to conceal smuggling operations.  The range of illicit-to-licit relationships is broad.  At one end, criminals draw on the public reputations of legitimate actors to maintain a facade of legality for their operations.  At the other end are specialists with skills or resources who have been completely subsumed into the criminal networks.  ', \"       The range of criminal activities that these transnational organized crime groups engage in is extremely broad.  While our review concentrated on the crimes these groups were committing in the United States, we see evidence that these groups are committing the same crimes from locations in many other countries as well.  I'd like to offer a few examples.\", '       Transnational organized criminals are penetrating key strategic markets.  Our review found that alliances between organized criminals and oligarchs from the former Soviet Union threaten U.S. businesses and domestic markets.  Industry officials in certain sectors like commodities fear that quasi-licit firms and individuals with major organized crime ties are gaining market share.  With their international business connections, large sums of money and political ties, some Eurasian oligarchs operate as quasi-legitimate business figures to open the doors of U.S. companies and markets to organized crime influence.', '       We also found that transnational organized crime groups increasingly use cyberspace to target U.S. consumers and businesses, using a variety of techniques to drain their bank accounts and steal their identities.  In addition to \"phishing\", advanced fee fraud schemes and Internet auction fraud, criminals use more sophisticated techniques such as the remote targeting of point-of-sale machines.  The U.S. Secret Service estimates that criminals using anonymous web sites to buy and sell stolen identities have caused billions of dollars in losses to the United States\\' financial infrastructure.  Some estimates indicate that online frauds perpetrated by Central European cybercrime networks alone have defrauded U.S. citizens or entities of approximately $1 billion in a single year.  ', '       Transnational organized crime groups are increasingly engaging in a variety of public sector fraud, including frauds against the U.S. Government.  Such crimes include food stamp and welfare fraud, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, and government grant and loan program fraud.  For example, in October 2010 seventy-three defendants, including a number of alleged members and associates of an Armenian-American organized crime enterprise, were charged with various health care fraud-related crimes involving more than $163 million in fraudulent billing to Medicare and insurance companies.', '       We also found that transnational organized criminal networks are increasingly active in stealing critical U.S. intellectual property, including through intrusions into corporate and proprietary computer networks.  Theft of this kind of property, ranging from movies to proprietary designs of high-tech devices and manufacturing processes, causes significant business losses and erodes our competitiveness in the global marketplace.  From 2005 to 2010 the yearly value of seizures in the United States of illegal products that violated intellectual property laws jumped from $93 million to $188 million.  Products originating in China accounted for 66 per cent of these seizures in 2010.', \"       Finally, transnational criminals prey upon weaknesses and differences in international transportation and customs security regimes.  Specialized criminal networks feature prominently in the trafficking of narcotics, the movement of contraband items, the counterfeiting of goods and the smuggling and trafficking of humans into the United States.  For example, between 2005 and 2007, we identified several Uzbek criminal networks engaged in human trafficking.  They operated cleaning companies that exploited guest workers to service national hotel and retail chains, and they moved operations regularly to avoid detection.  Similarly, drug cartels' control of smuggling routes along the 2,000 mile border with the United States is a key to their ability to make money.  Human traffickers have also exploited those same smuggling routes across the U.S.-Mexico border to target undocumented migrants for labor or sex trafficking.  \", '       What are the results of these disturbing trends and new patterns of crime?  In short, our review concluded that transnational organized crime has risen to the level of a national security threat.  Countries in key regions around the world are finding their governments penetrated, weakened and even taken over by organized crime, undermining their democratic institutions and prospects for economic growth.  Economies, including critical markets and the world financial system are being subverted, exploited and distorted by organized criminals through corruption and violence, making it harder for legitimate businesses to compete in those markets and harder for those economies to develop and provide jobs for the law abiding citizens. Terrorists and insurgents are increasingly turning to organized crime to generate funding and acquire logistical support to carry out their violent acts.  Cybercrime threatens sensitive government and corporate computer networks, undermines confidence in the international financial system, and costs consumers billions of dollars annually.  And despite our many successes, illicit drugs remain a serious threat to the health, safety, security and financial well-being of our citizens.', '       These are sobering findings, made even more so by the fact that we recognize that our domestic law enforcement, working alone, cannot defeat these threats.  Organized crime cases, involving informants, undercover agents, wiretaps, cooperating witnesses and sophisticated legal tools, are already among the most complex and challenging investigations undertaken by the Justice Department.  Transposed to an international setting, where much of our evidence and many of our witnesses and defendants reside in other countries, and where the rules governing investigations that cross numerous borders are quite complex and at times inadequate, the demands of an organized crime investigation can quickly outstrip any level of resources that we are able to devote to it.  The result in too many cases will inevitably be that the most culpable individuals are not brought to justice.  ', '       But, far from despairing, we believe that recognizing the scale of the challenges facing us is the first step to overcoming them.  Under the leadership of the White House, the Department of Justice and other parts of the U.S. government came together and developed the Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime, which was released in July of last year.  The Strategy set out several overarching goals to be achieved by our government to meet the threat of transnational organized crime.', '       First, we must protect our citizens and the citizens and nationals of our partner nations from the harm, violence and exploitation of transnational criminal networks.  Under the Strategy, we are targeting the networks that pose the gravest threat to safety and security, including those that traffic illicit drugs, arms and people, sell substandard, tainted and counterfeit goods, commit robberies, extortions and kidnappings, and seek to terrorize and intimidate through acts of torture and murder.', '       Second, we must help partner countries strengthen governance and transparency, break the ability of transnational criminal networks to corrupt public officials, and sever alliances between criminals and governments.  We recognize that we need willing, reliable and capable partners to combat the corruption and instability generated by transnational organized crime.  We are actively working with our international partners to develop capabilities to strengthen public safety, security and justice institutions to fight these threats.   ', '       Third, we must break the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protect our markets and financial systems from penetration by organized crime.  We have already begun a program of attacking the financial underpinnings of the top transnational criminals, stripping them of their illicit wealth, cutting off their access to the financial system, and exposing their criminal activities hidden behind legitimate fronts.', '       Finally, we must build international consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime.  Stopping organized crime is not a task limited to one government, or even many governments.  We must build new partnerships, new networks, with industry, finance, academia, civil society and non-governmental organizations, to combat organized crime networks.  We must protect press freedoms so that the media and journalists can expose the harms inflicted by organized crime.  We are working to deepen our understanding, information sharing and cooperation with foreign partners and multilateral institutions, and through this we will further international norms against tolerating or sponsoring crime in all its forms, including cyberspace.', '       To achieve these goals, the Strategy set in motion actions across the U.S. government, starting new initiatives and enhancing existing ones, and bringing the different agencies together so that we could have the greatest impact on organized crime.', \"       At the Justice Department, we had already begun to tackle transnational organized crime.  We recognized that part of the challenge posed by transnational organized crime lay in the fact that information concerning these groups was scattered across the federal law enforcement community.  We therefore began by bringing together the heads of nine federal law enforcement agencies, from the FBI, DEA and ICE to the Postal Inspectors and Department of Labor, to advise the Attorney General in an Organized Crime Council.  Their deliberations resulted in the creation of the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center in 2009.  This Center pools the resources of the nine agencies, plus federal prosecutors, in a setting where all of the agencies' relevant information can be sifted to produce a complete picture of the workings of a criminal organization.  Furthermore, the Center produces this picture in a form that can immediately be put to use by agents investigating the organization.  We also created a top target list for organized crime groups common to all nine federal agencies.  At a minimal cost, these steps did much to unify the disparate efforts of many agencies and provide a single focus on the greatest perceived transnational organized crime threats.\", \"       As part of the Administration's overall Strategy, the Justice Department also took a hard look at the legal tools that we are using to fight organized crime.  We found that many of our statutes had not kept up with developments in the criminal world.  Our money laundering statutes, groundbreaking when first enacted, had gaps when applied to illicit proceeds in the U.S. that were generated by criminal activity in other countries.  Our famous anti-racketeering statute, known as RICO, did not explicitly cover some of the crimes being committed by transnational organized crime groups - like foreign bribery or certain types of computer fraud - and recent court decisions made it unclear whether RICO could even be used to prosecute an organized crime group if most of their activities were transnational in nature.   To remedy these and other gaps the Department prepared a series of legislative proposals that were announced at the same time as the Strategy and that are now beginning to work their way through Congress.  \", \"       The Strategy recognized that agencies outside the category of law enforcement had a critical role to play in the fight against transnational organized crime.  Most importantly, perhaps, the Strategy was accompanied by an Executive Order, signed by the President, which directed the Treasury Department to establish a sanctions program to block the property of and prohibit transactions with significant criminal networks that threaten national security, foreign policy, or economic interests.  This power had previously been restricted to terrorists and narcotics kingpins, but was now extended to other transnational organized crime groups.  By shutting designated individuals and their companies out of the U.S. financial system, these sanctions programs have the power to affect criminals operating around the world.  Just last week the Treasury Department announced the first individual sanctions under this order, naming seven members and associates of the Brothers' Circle Eurasian organized crime group and two members of the Japanese Yakuza criminal organizations, and prohibiting U.S. individuals and companies from doing business with them.  The Justice Department and the Treasury Department are working closely with each other to further develop this program.\", '       The Strategy also took direct aim at those criminals who try to portray themselves as legitimate businessmen and seek to gain respectability by traveling to and conducting business in the United States.  A Presidential Proclamation under the Immigration and Naturalization Act gave the State Department the power to deny U.S. entry to transnational criminal aliens and others who have been targeted for financial sanctions.  The State Department was also directed to establish a new rewards program, expanding upon the success of the narcotics rewards program, to obtain information that leads to the arrest and conviction of leaders of transnational criminal organizations that pose the greatest threats to national security.', '       To tie these efforts together, the Strategy also directed the establishment of an interagency working group to identify those transnational organized crime threats that present a sufficiently high national security risk and coordinate the work of the whole spectrum of U.S. agencies in acting against that threat.', '       Woven throughout the Strategy is the recognition that transnational organized crime is a threat to law abiding citizens of all nations, and that nations must work together if it is to be defeated.  We understand that nations are affected by transnational organized crime in different ways, and that different nations have different capabilities to fight these groups.  But we must come together and combine those capabilities if we hope to ultimately prevail against this growing menace.  ', \"   We welcome today's Hemispheric Meeting sponsored by our Mexican hosts and the OAS as a sign that our concerns are shared by our partners in the Americas.  Our work at this conference is critically important, for it is here over the next two days that we can reach a common understanding of the problem of transnational organized crime, and begin to craft a united response.  Looking out among you, I am confident that we will succeed.  \", '    Thank you, again, for the opportunity to speak with you this morning.  It is a positive step that we are here together, forging a path forward to combat this evolving global threat.  ']\n",

      "['      Good Afternoon.  Thank you, President Khoo, for that kind introduction.  Thank you Secretary General Noble for hosting this meeting.  I would also like to thank our host country and the people of Vietnam for their warm hospitality and I want to congratulate them on their 20th anniversary of being a member of Interpol.  And I would like to thank INTERPOL and the National Central Bureaus from around the world for organizing and attending this extraordinary event - celebrating our joint achievements, building upon our relationships, and developing a path forward for this organization.  It is an honor to be here and to have an opportunity to address the global law enforcement community.', \"      During my tenure as the Deputy Attorney General, I have come to learn firsthand of the unprecedented level of international cooperation between member countries in developing the critical law enforcement tools of 24/7 communication, information sharing, and coordinated responses.  The unwavering dedication to mission by INTERPOL and the world's National Central Bureaus is both inspiring and critical to our joint successes in combating crime.  And the broad array of issues you deal with on a daily basis and on a global scale is simply astonishing: terrorism, transnational organized crime, stolen and lost travel documents, human trafficking, fugitive operations, environmental crimes, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, piracy, and repatriation of lost and stolen art - just to name a few.\", '      The United States and its citizens have benefitted greatly from our robust partnership with INTERPOL and its member countries and allies.  You all have played a significant role in adding a layer of security around our borders.  For that, we are truly grateful - and we pledge our continued support for the mission of INTERPOL.  We must all continue to work together in order to remain more globally organized than the criminals we pursue.', \"      To that end, I'd like to talk about an area in desperate need of INTERPOL's continued leadership and support - and in need of member countries' investment, vigilance, and cooperation - it is the area of combating cybercrime.\", \"      Cybercrime has become a global crisis and a worldwide epidemic.  It takes many forms:  It can be used to steal valuable intellectual property; it can be used to steal financial information such as account numbers and passwords allowing access to people's financial assets; it can be used to effect a denial of service attacks; and it can be used to re-direct point of sale transactions to divert the proceeds to the criminal elements.  As President Khoo noted this morning, the loses from this type of crime is hundreds of billions of dollars a year and it is the new medium for trans-national organized crime.\", '      But beyond traditional forms of crime, the global cyber threat also poses frightening national security threats.  From disruption of critical infrastructure - such as the power grid, nuclear power plants, financial and banking institutions, transportation systems, and vital communication systems - to the recruitment, inspiration and incitement of terrorists; from the theft of classified information to the infection of the supply chain.  It is organized, borderless, and dangerous.  It presents unique and ever-evolving challenges for law enforcement.  It can only be fought through the cooperative efforts of all of our countries.  Let me give you some examples.', \"      In August 2008, the United States charged 11 members of an international hacking ring - located in the United States, Estonia, Ukraine, the People's Republic of China, and Belarus.  It was responsible for the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers obtained from the databases of various retailers.  The defendants included one of the world's top hackers, Albert Gonzalez, and one of the world's top traffickers in stolen account information, Maksym Yastremski. Gonzalez pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Yastremski was convicted on related charges in Turkey and sentenced to 30 years in prison.\", '      Earlier this month, in another devastating form of cybercrime, a U.S. citizen - and previously convicted sex offender -- was sentenced to life in prison.  His crime: using his office computer in the United States to engage in an online chat with a young woman in the Philippines and to entice her and her 2-year-old child to produce child pornography via a web camera.  ', '      One of the more worrisome trends in cybercrime is the growing prevalence of \"botnets\" - networks of computers that have been infected by malicious software designed to take control of countless PCs without the user\\'s knowledge or consent.  This network of infected computers is used to steal financial information, launch denial of service attacks to disable targeted computer systems; or gain access to other networks and computers. ', '      In April 2011, U.S. law enforcement disabled a botnet known as \"Coreflood\" -- created nearly a decade ago and believed to have infected over 2 million computers worldwide.  After installation, the malicious software allowed infected computers to be controlled remotely for the purpose of stealing the users\\' key strokes that revealed personal and financial information.  The stolen data was then used to gain access to financial accounts and steal funds.  While we could not find the defendants, the botnet was nevertheless disabled using a number of investigative and law enforcement tools, including: the filing of a civil complaint, the execution of search and seizure warrants on servers and domain names, and the issuance of a restraining order. ', '      These are just a few examples, but they help us realize the nature of the problem.  How diverse it is, how extensive it is, and how much work we have to do to keep up with these criminals.  One of the reasons I was anxious to be here today was to tell you that, on behalf of President Obama, Attorney General Holder, and the entire United States law enforcement community, we pledge our commitment to each of you - and to all of our partners and allies - to advance our joint and global fight against cybercrime.  As part of this effort, the United States has developed an International Strategy for Cyberspace that complements the strategies already developed by our international partners and allies, including the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.  ', \"      Much like our commitment to INTERPOL, the United States' strategic approach to combating cybercrime aims to unify our engagement with our international partners and highlight our domestic and international policy priorities.  The strategic plan serves as a roadmap for our government agencies to better define and coordinate their roles in international cyberspace policy, to execute a specific way forward, and to plan for future implementation.  For those nations that have not done so already, I invite you to join us in realizing this vision of security and openness in our networked world.  In particular, I urge countries to become parties to the Budapest Convention.  I also call upon the private sector, our communities and citizens, and end-users to reinforce these efforts through partnership, awareness, and action. \", \"      As we discuss and plan for these important issues, let me be clear about one thing, the United States fundamentally believes that cyberspace governance does not require the wholesale reinvention of customary international law.  Rather, the Strategy and the Cybercrime Convention recognize traditional principles of inter-governmental conduct that are essential to any international environment: they promote order, peace, and mutual respect. They advance basic human dignity; and promotes freedom and economic competition.  We are endeavoring to build a consensus of nations that see the value in global networks that are open to new innovations, interoperable the world over, reliable enough to support people's work, and secure enough to earn their trust.   \", \"      Despite the many successes to which the Cybercrime Convention has contributed, we cannot become complacent as our adversaries will continue to evolve their techniques and their scams.  There are only so many ways to walk into a bank and rob it - but there are an infinite number of ways to hack into the world's finances.  Because this evolution in technology was expected when the convention was negotiated, it was drafted to be elastic, to meet future needs without having to be amended.  As the drafters understood, cybercrime is a 21st century problem and can only be combated using the 21st century techniques in the convention.  We must continue to encourage more nations to ratify the Budapest Convention and to join with us in developing and improving our abilities to combat the global cybercrime threat. \", '      The 2014 opening of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore offers a tremendous opportunity for INTERPOL and its member countries to expand operations and further invest in capacity building, forensics, training, research, and the development of best practices in the area of cybersecurity.  We must take advantage of this opportunity and utilize all law enforcement tools available to combat cybercrime.  And we must continue to think outside the box in search of new methods and techniques in order to stay ahead of this problem.', '      But I have great hope that we will succeed at this, because our working relationship with our law enforcement partners from around the world has never been stronger.  In the area of cybercrime, this collaborative approach has resulted in significant progress in detecting and combating electronic penetrations, data thefts, and cyber attacks on critical information systems.  ', '      One recent collaborative effort culminated in the disruption of an internet fraud scheme conducted by several networks of organized cyber criminals in Romania and the United States in July 2011.  In a coordinated criminal investigation, Romanian law enforcement officials executed 117 searches targeting individuals operating a fraudulent scheme involving the fake sales of cars and boats over the internet to thousands of victims in the United States and elsewhere.  As a result of this robust cooperation, more than 100 individuals have been charged in Romania and 21 individuals have been charged in the United States.', '      In another case, U.S. law enforcement joined forces with our international partners to investigate an international hacking ring involving individuals from Estonia, Russia, Moldova, and the United States.  The perpetrators hacked into a computer network operated by a credit card processing company and, using sophisticated techniques, compromised the data encryption used to protect customer information on payroll debit cards.  The hackers then generated counterfeit payroll debit cards and circulated them to a network of \"cashers.\"  In a span of less than 12 hours, the cashers used these cards to withdraw over $9 million from more than 2,100 ATMs in at least 280 cities in the United States, Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, and Canada.  Notably, in the course of this investigation, law enforcement uncovered a previously undetected hacking technique that compromised the bank\\'s encryption system.  This information was disseminated throughout the banking sector to prevent future execution of similar schemes.', '      These inter-governmental investigations and prosecutions are just two examples of what we are capable of doing when we share intelligence and resources to combat cybercrime.  Without our law enforcement partners from around the world - none of these results would have been possible. ', \"      The last critical aspect of the cyber dilemma I'd like to discuss is the simple truth that the rapid collection and retention of electronic evidence is critical to combating cybercrime.  Perpetrators may only be caught and brought to justice if evidence of their criminal activity is timely captured and properly preserved for law enforcement use.  As we all know, the investigation and prosecution of these cases can take years.  This is particularly true in the area of child exploitation, where the mass transmissions are instantaneous, the origin is easily disguised, and it generally takes a significant period of time to trace the evidence, identify the victims, and bring the perpetrators to justice. \", \"      As law enforcement professionals we have two important duties to always keep in mind - effective detection, apprehension, an punishment of criminals AND the protections of privacy and civil liberties so critical to maintaining our free societies.  In order to do our jobs properly, we must find a way to accomplish them both.  If you just want to enforce the law and give little regard to privacy and civil liberties, it's not so hard to do.  Similarly, if you just want to focus on the protection of privacy and civil liberties at the sacrifice of effective law enforcement, it's also not so hard to do.  But therein lies the challenge for us.  To honor our sacred duty as law enforcement professionals, we must do both.  And frankly we can do both.\", '      We need to collect and retain vital evidentiary data in the cyber world.  Evidence of crime, evidence of terrorism, evidence of child exploitation.  We must do this to keep our countries and their people safe.  But we can also establish protections and restrictions on the access to this evidence so that we ensure the freedoms we hold so dear.  But in order to fulfill this dual responsibility we all, as law enforcement professionals, need to go back to our countries and make sure that our governments and our citizens understand that both law enforcement and privacy can be honored and must be honored, if we are going  to effectively deal with the scourge of cybercrime, in all of its forms.', '      Standing alone, no country or law enforcement agency has the perspective necessary to fully assess the nature of the threats we face or to adequately address them.  Only by communicating effectively, sharing intelligence, and combining resources - with our government and law enforcement partners, our allies, our international business and legal communities, and our citizens - can we truly understand current and emerging threats and create an effective strategy to anticipate and combat these crimes.  The worldwide cybercrime epidemic is an extraordinary challenge for all of us.  But, by working together across borders and continents, we can turn the tables on cyber criminals and the complex and ever evolving threats that they present.', \"      Thank you all again for attending this extraordinary event and for all that you and your nations have done, and will continue to do, to support INTERPOL's mission and the goal of keeping our countries and our world safe.  \"]\n",

      "['  WASHINGTON - Kexue Huang, a Chinese national and a former resident of Carmel, Ind., pleaded guilty today to one count of economic espionage to benefit a component of the Chinese government and one count of theft of trade secrets.', '   ', '  The guilty plea was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General for National Security Lisa O. Monaco, U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Hogsett of the Southern District of Indiana, U.S. Attorney B. Todd Jones of the District of Minnesota, and Robert J. Holley, Special Agent in Charge of the Indianapolis Field Office of the FBI.', '   ', '  This is the first trade secret prosecution in Indiana under a provision of the Economic Espionage Act that prohibits trade secret theft intended to benefit a component of a foreign government.  Since its enactment in 1996, there have been a total of eight such cases charged nationwide under the Economic Espionage Act. ', '   ', \"  Huang, 46, pleaded guilty to the charges before U.S. District Judge William T. Lawrence in the Southern District of Indiana.  In July 2010, Huang was charged in an indictment filed in the Southern District of Indiana for misappropriating and transporting trade secrets to the People's Republic of China (PRC) while working as a research scientist at Dow AgroSciences LLC.  Today, a separate indictment filed in the District of Minnesota was unsealed, charging Huang with stealing a trade secret from a second company, Cargill Inc.\", '   ', '  According to court documents, from January 2003 until February 2008, Huang was employed as a research scientist at Dow, a leading international agricultural company based in Indianapolis that provides agrochemical and biotechnology products.  In 2005, Huang became a research leader for Dow in strain development related to unique, proprietary organic insecticides marketed worldwide.', '   ', \"  As a Dow employee, Huang signed an agreement that outlined his obligations in handling confidential information, including trade secrets, and prohibited him from disclosing any confidential information without Dow's consent. Dow employed several layers of security to preserve and maintain confidentiality and to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of its trade secrets.                                                   \", '             ', '  Huang admitted that during his employment at Dow, he misappropriated several Dow trade secrets.  According to plea documents, from 2007 to 2010, Huang transferred and delivered the stolen Dow trade secrets to individuals in Germany and the PRC.  With the assistance of these individuals, Huang used the stolen materials to conduct unauthorized research with the intent to benefit foreign universities that were instrumentalities of the PRC government.  Huang also admitted that he pursued steps to develop and produce the misappropriated Dow trade secrets in the PRC, including identifying manufacturing facilities in the PRC that would allow him to compete directly with Dow in the established organic pesticide market.', '   ', \"  According to court documents, after Huang left Dow, he was hired in March 2008 by Cargill, an international producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial and industrial products and services.  Huang worked as a biotechnologist for Cargill until July 2009 and signed a confidentiality agreement promising never to disclose any trade secrets or other confidential information of Cargill.  Huang admitted that during his employment with Cargill, he stole one of the company's trade secrets - a key component in the manufacture of a new food product, which he later disseminated to another person, specifically a student at Hunan Normal University in the PRC.\", '   ', \"  According to the plea agreement, the aggregated loss from Huang's criminal conduct exceeds $7 million but is less than $20 million. \", '   ', '  \"Mr. Huang used his insider status at two of America\\'s largest agricultural companies to steal valuable trade secrets for use in his native China,\" said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  \"We cannot allow U.S. citizens or foreign nationals to hand sensitive business information over to competitors in other countries, and we will continue our vigorous criminal enforcement of economic espionage and trade secret laws.  These crimes present a danger to the U.S. economy and jeopardize our nation\\'s leadership in innovation.\"', '   ', '  \"Today\\'s plea underscores the continuing threat posed by the theft of business secrets for the benefit of China and other nations,\" said Assistant Attorney General Monaco.         ', '   ', '  U.S. Attorney Hogsett noted that it is the first time economic espionage has been charged in the Southern District of Indiana.  Hogsett remarked that \"as U.S. Attorney, I am committed to working with Hoosier businesses who have been victimized and doing everything within our influence to protect Hoosier companies.\"  Hogsett praised Dow for its cooperation with the investigation and prosecution, noting that \"companies must first report and then work with federal investigators and prosecutors if we are to stem the illicit export of trade secrets vital to the economy not only of Indiana but the United States.\"  Hogsett also stated, \"the dual prosecutions from Indiana and Minnesota should serve as a warning to anyone who is considering robbing American companies of their information and weaken the American economy by selling that information to foreign governments or others that he will face severe consequences.  The federal agents and prosecutors who worked tirelessly in these two cases are to be commended for their hard work and dedication.\"', '   ', '  FBI Special Agent in Charge Holley stated:  \"Among the various economic espionage and theft of trade secret cases that the FBI has investigated in Indiana, the vast majority involve an inside employee with legitimate access who is stealing in order to benefit another organization or country.  This type of threat, which the FBI refers to as the Insider Threat, often causes the most damage.  In order to maintain our competitive advantage in these sectors, industry must identify their most important equities, realize that they are a target, implement internal protection mechanisms to protect their intellectual property, and communicate issues of concern immediately to the FBI.\"', '   ', '  At sentencing, Huang faces a maximum prison sentence of 15 years on the economic espionage charge and 10 years on the theft of trade secrets charge.', '   ', \"  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia J.

      "[\"Thank you, Superintendent O'Grady, for that generous introduction.  I am grateful for your warm welcome, and delighted to be here with you, and with so many international law enforcement colleagues and other partners in the fight against intellectual property crime. \", 'I want particularly to thank the leaders of INTERPOL, EUROPOL and the Cuerpo Nacional de Policia for hosting this conference, in partnership with Underwriters Laboratories.  Last year, the Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, addressed you in Hong Kong, and it is my honor and privilege to represent the U.S. Department of Justice today in Madrid. ', 'I was here earlier this year, and it gives me great pleasure to be again in the Spanish capital.  Later today, I will have the honor of visiting with Deputy Prosecutor General Juan Jose Martin-Casallo Lopez, and two of his top prosecutors, Antonio Salinas and Jose Ramon Norena Salto, to discuss Spanish law enforcement efforts, as well as how we can continue to cooperate in our efforts against intellectual property theft and other crimes.   There are few countries as beautiful, or as bountiful, as Spain, with as rich a history, or as strong a law enforcement relationship with the United States. ', 'It is reflective of the international scope of the challenges we face in fighting intellectual property crime that this conference should be held in Asia one year and Europe the next, and that it continues to bring together members of law enforcement from so many countries around the world, as well as industry stakeholders, leaders and other international partners.  Indeed, if there is one thing that we all recognize, it is that intellectual property crime is a problem of global dimension.  Technological advances have created unprecedented opportunities for businesses to market and sell their intellectual property anywhere in the world.  But these same advances also allow trademark counterfeiters, trade secret thieves, and copyright pirates to operate in an essentially borderless environment.  Victims may reside in one country, while the thieves who steal their IP hide out in another.  IP criminals in Europe may sell counterfeit products to consumers in North America, without ever needing to leave their homes.  Recognizing the potential economic rewards offered by IP crime, and perceiving - incorrectly - the risk of getting caught or facing significant penalties as minimal, transnational organized criminal enterprises have increasingly turned to IP crime to increase their illegal profits.  And the effects are felt by all of us.  In short, in our global economy, no country is immune from the scourge of IP crime, and each of us must be able to depend upon the others to catch and deter IP criminals.', 'For that reason, international law enforcement is only as effective at fighting IP crime as its weakest link.  In the United States - and I suspect the same is true in countries around the globe - it is not always obvious to people why we should devote significant resources to fighting IP crime - resources that could go instead to fighting violent crime, for example, or public corruption.  Conferences like this one serve the important purpose of raising global awareness about the negative consequences of IP crime, and showing those who need convincing how critically important it is that we work together to stop IP crime, and punish those who commit it.  Everyone in this room knows that counterfeit pharmaceuticals, counterfeit automotive and defense-industry parts, and other counterfeit consumer products can cause serious harm to people and endanger their lives; and that companies whose trade secrets are stolen or whose goods are counterfeited may be forced to downsize or go out of business, costing individuals their jobs.  Nevertheless, the public perception at times persists that IP crime is victimless.  It is therefore one of our important duties here this week to spread the message about the significant, and very real, costs of IP crime. ', 'In addition, this conference serves the important function of bringing together people from across the globe who share a common goal:  to reduce, and eventually eliminate, IP crime, in our home countries and abroad.  Today, there are representatives here from China, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Spain, Lebanon, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Canada, the United States, Chile, and many other countries.  We have the unique opportunity at this gathering to strengthen relationships, share lessons learned, and set out our way forward together.', 'Our collective commitment to ending IP crime must begin, for each of our countries, at home.  In the United States today, IP enforcement is a top priority.  As President Obama said last year, we are determined to \"aggressively protect our intellectual property\" because \"[o]ur single greatest asset is the innovation and the ingenuity and creativity\" of our people.  And I don\\'t think it\\'s an exaggeration to say that the Obama Administration has made intellectual property enforcement a higher priority than any other U.S. Administration in recent memory.', \"In 2009, for example, President Obama appointed Victoria Espinel as the first U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, or IPEC, to coordinate the federal government's activities in enforcing our intellectual property laws.  The Justice Department works closely with Ms. Espinel's office on a range of issues, including the development of legislative recommendations aimed at addressing gaps in our legislative authority and improving IP enforcement government-wide.  These recommendations, which were unveiled in March of this year, include proposals for enhanced criminal penalties for economic espionage and trade secret theft, drug counterfeiting offenses, and other IP crimes.  They also include a recommendation for creating a felony offense for streaming copyrighted works, and giving law enforcement the authority to seek wiretaps in criminal copyright and trademark cases, so that we can stop IP thieves in their tracks.\", 'We also work closely with the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, or IPR Center, which has developed into a critical resource for law enforcement, using the expertise of its many member agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as law enforcement from Mexico and Canada, to coordinate IP law enforcement actions.  I am sure you will hear more about the great work of the IPR Center from my colleague John Morton, when he speaks with you tomorrow.', \"Most significantly, from my perspective, under Attorney General Holder's leadership, IP enforcement has become one of the Justice Department's signature priorities, with the Department leading the government's charge in enforcing the nation's IP laws.  Last year, the Attorney General announced the formation of a new Justice Department Task Force on Intellectual Property, whose mission is to coordinate the Department's overall response to the growing threat of IP crime.  \", \"The Department's response has many facets.  It includes the recovery of civil penalties from importers of counterfeit goods; the award of grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners to help improve their capacity to address IP crime; and, of course, it includes vigorous criminal enforcement. \", \"Over the past two-and-a-half years, as Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, I have had the privilege of leading nearly 600 lawyers in enforcing the nation's criminal laws.  Our prosecutors bring cases in areas ranging from Medicare fraud and money laundering to international narcotics trafficking, gang violence and public corruption.  And one of our key areas of focus is the investigation and prosecution of intellectual property crime. \", \"Together with the 94 federal prosecutors' offices around the country - which we refer to as U.S. Attorneys' Offices - the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, or CCIPS, is at the forefront of these efforts. \", \"CCIPS has over 40 highly-specialized prosecutors and computer forensics experts, who prosecute cases around the country, and who work closely with a network of over 260 specially trained Computer Hacking & Intellectual Property, or CHIP, prosecutors located in the U.S. Attorneys' Offices.     \", 'Together, CCIPS and CHIP prosecutors aggressively investigate and prosecute IP crimes.  This year, we have prosecuted significant cases in our key enforcement areas.  In March, for example, in the area of trade secret theft, the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in Manhattan secured a 97-month sentence for a former computer programmer at the investment bank Goldman Sachs for stealing valuable, proprietary computer code belonging to the bank.  During the sentencing proceeding, the judge remarked that the defendant\\'s conduct was \"audacious - motivated solely by greed, and  . . . characterized by supreme disloyalty to his employer.\" ', 'In the area of health and safety, we have continued to pursue cases against counterfeiters of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and built upon \"Operation Network Raider,\" an international law enforcement initiative targeting the illegal manufacture and distribution of counterfeit network hardware, including hardware intended for use by the U.S. military.   When it was announced last year, the operation had resulted in more than 30 felony convictions and more than 700 seizures of counterfeit Cisco network hardware and labels with an estimated retail value of more than $143 million.  Indeed, 11 days ago, following a three-week trial earlier this year, a Virginia woman was sentenced to five years in prison for trafficking in counterfeit Cisco goods and labels manufactured in China.', 'In the area of piracy and counterfeiting, we also have been aggressive.  On the Monday after the U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving last year - so-called \"Cyber Monday\"- Attorney General Holder announced a coordinated law enforcement effort known as \"Operation in Our Sights II,\" during which we seized 82 domain names of websites used to promote the sale and distribution of counterfeit goods and illegal versions of copyrighted works.  And less than two weeks ago, we charged five individuals for their involvement in a website called NinjaVideo.net, which allegedly provided millions of visitors with the ability to illegally download infringing copies of copyright-protected movies and television programs in high-quality format. ', \"In many instances, our prosecutions have benefited from cooperation with international law enforcement.  Three weeks ago, for example, an individual from Massachusetts pleaded guilty to economic espionage for providing his company's trade secrets to an undercover agent posing as an Israeli intelligence officer.  The Israeli government provided important cooperation on the case.   And last year, we announced economic espionage charges against a research scientist for Dow AgroSciences LLC, who allegedly misappropriated and transported the company's trade secrets to China and Germany.  German authorities provided us with essential assistance in this investigation.\", \"These cases, which are just two examples of many in which we coordinate with our foreign law enforcement partners, are reminders that IP crime so frequently transcends national borders.  At the Justice Department, we are acutely aware that IP crime is an international problem.  We live in a world where new technologies offer almost limitless opportunities for businesses - both large and small - to market and distribute their goods and digital content to consumers around the world.  Unfortunately, these same technologies are exploited by individuals and organized criminal enterprises to create high-quality knock-offs and perfect digital copies for global distribution.  Trademark counterfeiters often choose to make their illegal goods in one country and then smuggle them for sale into our own, rather than to manufacture them where they're sold.  And websites that offer pirated copies of new or even pre-release movies, music, software, or games often operate internationally.  The reason is simple:  not every country treats IP enforcement as a top priority, or has the expertise to prosecute IP cases effectively.   \", 'In the United States, we are working hard with our foreign law enforcement allies to reduce the global supply of pirated and counterfeit goods, and to strengthen IP enforcement capacity internationally.  Last October, for example, after addressing this conference in Hong Kong, Attorney General Holder traveled to China to meet with senior law enforcement officials, including the Minister of Public Security, and work with the Chinese to improve bilateral cooperation on IP enforcement.  And later this month, for the first time, the FBI will station an agent at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to focus exclusively on criminal IP enforcement.', 'We have also been working to build strong relationships with our law enforcement partners by participating in international training programs.  Indeed, over the past six years, the Justice Department has participated in IP enforcement training and education programs for more than 12,000 prosecutors, investigators, judicial officers, and other officials from over 30 countries.  Strengthening the enforcement capacity of other nations not only helps to provide them with the tools they need to stop IP criminals who target other countries; it also sends a strong message to would-be criminals that there will be no safe havens for IP crime.  ', \"Another aspect of our international outreach work is the Department's Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator, or IPLEC, program.  Through the IPLEC program, we send experienced federal prosecutors overseas to take the lead on our IP protection efforts in key spots around the globe.  These prosecutors work closely with law enforcement authorities abroad to share information and evidence regarding joint investigations and to enhance IP enforcement training programs.  We currently have one IPLEC stationed in Bangkok, Thailand, who manages our IP protection efforts in Southeast Asia, and until recently we had a second IPLEC stationed in Sofia, Bulgaria, who was managing our efforts in Eastern Europe.\", 'These prosecutors are critical to our international outreach and enforcement efforts.  So much so that President Obama has asked the United States Congress, in his 2012 budget request, to fund a new Justice Department program that would place six International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property coordinators, or \"ICHIPs,\" in key locations around the world.', 'IP crime is a serious threat.  It jeopardizes the health and safety of consumers.  It stifles innovation and creativity.  And it has negative effects on the global economy.  As the United States has stepped up its IP enforcement, other countries have as well.  Countries around the globe recently worked together with the United States to finalize the text of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement; Mexico, the Philippines, and Russia all enacted important IP legislation; and right here in Spain, the government enacted new legislation to provide a mechanism for rights holders to remove or block access to infringing content online.', \"These are important steps.  But we have a great deal left to do, and many challenges ahead.  President Obama, Attorney General Holder, and other U.S. government leaders are committed to aggressive IP enforcement.  As the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, I am personally committed to vigorously enforcing our criminal IP statutes, and bringing trade secret thieves, counterfeiters, intellectual property pirates, and others to justice.  By your presence here, I know that you are as well.  The problem of IP crime stretches across territorial boundaries.  Effective enforcement starts in each of our home countries, and gathers strength through international coordination and cooperation.  Let us continue moving forward in this fight, united by our common purpose to protect our respective nations' intellectual property and hold IP criminals to account for their conduct.  Thank you.\"]\n",

      "['Thank you, U.S. Attorney Dave Capp, for your kind words, and your two and a half decades of distinguished service here in the Northern District of Indiana.', \"As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and as interim U.S. Attorney - on no less than three occasions - you've proven both your leadership skills and legal expertise. Today, in your role as United States Attorney, you serve as an advisor to me and as an example to your colleagues. And the contributions that you and your team are making are felt across - and far beyond - this District.\", \"It's a pleasure to stand with you this morning - and I want to thank all of you for welcoming me back to Hammond. As Dave just mentioned, I had my very first jury trial here - in your old courthouse. What Dave - very graciously - failed to mention is that I ended up losing that case. But I learned an awful lot here - and it's wonderful to return to the Northern District today.\", \"I am deeply grateful for the outstanding work that Dave and his colleagues - along with the FBI's Indianapolis Field Office, the United States Steel Corporation, and so many other law enforcement and private sector partners - have done to bring us all together.\", \"In particular, I'd like to recognize Michael Welch, the Indianapolis FBI Special-Agent-in-Charge, for his dedicated service - and for taking the time to be here this morning. I'd also like to thank each and every one of our participants - from across the private sector and every level of government and law enforcement - for your leadership in addressing one of the most urgent, and complex, global challenges we face: the problem, and increasing prevalence, of cybercrime.\", \"It's a privilege to take part in this critical summit - the very first of its kind to focus exclusively on cyber security challenges and solutions. I appreciate this opportunity to salute the proactive, innovative, and collaborative approach that has been adopted here in the Northern District to address this issue. Not only is this approach working, today it's being strengthened by the diverse group of stakeholders assembled here - ready to work together, to share insights and expertise, and to lend your voices to a growing national dialogue.\", 'You are attorneys and investigators, business leaders and public servants, prosecutors and law enforcement agents. You represent major industrial corporations, burgeoning tech companies, government agencies, and private security firms. And although you may bring different perspectives to the issue of cyber security - in one way or another - each of you serves on the front lines of this fight every single day.', \"As we open this landmark summit, I know we are united by our common goals: security, opportunity, openness, and prosperity. But we're also bound by our shared values - and joined together by our collective concerns.\", \"In this age of seamless global commerce and instant communication, more individuals, companies, institutions, and even governments are reliant on electronic networks and information systems than ever before. As communities across Indiana and around the country struggle to overcome the effects of an historic recession, we all stand to reap enormous benefits from the commercial and technological advances we've seen in just the last few decades - but only if the information technology being used to drive social, economic, and political progress is secure.\", \"In recent years, we've seen clear, and alarming, advances in the sophistication and commercialization of crimes involving electronic networks. And the staggering volume of money being stolen online today has the potential to threaten not only the security of our nation - but the integrity of our government, the stability of our economy, and the safety of our people.\", \"That's why conversations like the one we begin today are so important.  Many of the 21st -century threats we face - to both our national and economic security - have no precedent. They know no borders. And they demand - not only our constant attention, but also a comprehensive, collaborative, and well-coordinated response.  One that's nimble enough to fight complex - and constantly evolving - transnational threats.\", 'Of course, the success of any such response must be founded on strong cooperation between key public and private stakeholders at every level. It must focus on breaking down traditional barriers to communication and cross-sector engagement. And it must be predicated on bringing new partners to the table - and making the most of precious resources.', \"Today's summit is an affirmation of this promise - and a vindication of the collaborative approach that you've helped to pioneer. With this gathering, we send a strong and unmistakable message: that a new era of public-private cooperation, engagement, and vigilance has begun.\", \"This is now true all across the country. But, here in Northern Indiana, you were ahead of your time. Nearly a decade ago, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, area FBI and U.S. Attorney's offices convened partners from across the region to help identify and combat emerging national - and cyber - security threats. Since then, the interdisciplinary relationships that you've forged - and the steps that you've taken to keep pace with emerging challenges - have been nothing short of remarkable.\", \"During this same period, we've also seen major progress on an international scale. Since I became Attorney General more than two years ago, I've worked to make certain that cyber security is a top priority for our nation's Department of Justice. And I've traveled all over the world to engage key allies in this work.\", 'Several weeks ago, I met with a number of my international counterparts in Hungary - where I spoke at an event commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. A decade ago - just as your Lakefront Infrastructure Working Group began holding its initial meetings - the United States became one of the first nations to support this unprecedented, much-needed agreement, which provided a path for allies around the world to collectively address cyber threats and criminal activities, while also safeguarding civil rights.', \"As a result of this and other joint efforts, we're now working with our international partners to advance investigations and prosecutions like never before. We have agents and attorneys in place across the globe, where they work alongside local law enforcement teams to identify and combat cyber security threats. We're able to respond to potential problems more quickly and effectively than ever. And the results of such unprecedented levels of collaboration are clear.\", \"In just the last few months, the Justice Department has brought cases against a number of criminal conspirators for their roles in coordinated cybercrimes that, according to court documents, netted nearly 1.5 million dollars from U.S. victims. We've announced takedowns of significant criminal groups operating from Romania, Egypt, and elsewhere that had been victimizing American businesses and citizens - including children.\", 'We also conducted an extensive operation to disable an international criminal network that had infected more than two million computers worldwide with malicious software. Until we stepped in - with the help of industry and security experts, as well as key international partners - this malware was providing criminals with the capabilities to capture bank account numbers, user names, and other sensitive information online.', 'The Department has also joined with other agencies across the Administration to strengthen our efforts - both nationally and internationally - in combating intellectual property crimes - something I know is a top concern for area business leaders.', \"And as we've seen here in Indiana - as recently as last summer - such crimes are not victimless. In August, FBI agents arrested a Chinese national - who had served as a researcher for Dow AgroSciences, headquartered in Indianapolis - on charges of economic espionage to benefit a foreign government. Before being fired from Dow in 2008, he allegedly violated his company's confidentiality policy, stole trade secrets as well as property, and sent them to the People's Republic of China - where he is accused of directing others to further research and develop them, advancing Chinese national interests and potentially costing his former employer as much as 100 million dollars.\", \"This case - one of only a handful that's ever been brought on such charges - is being prosecuted by the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Criminal Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Indiana. It is slated to go to trial in the fall. But it's just one of many examples of our work to keep critical financial information secure - and to prevent the electronic transport and use of sensitive and proprietary materials.\", 'Another key example of our success in this ongoing effort is last November\\'s \"Cyber Monday\" takedown. On the Monday following Thanksgiving - which is now called \"Cyber Monday\" because it\\'s known as the busiest online shopping day of the year - the Department announced a coordinated law enforcement operation that seized more than 80 domain names to prevent the sale of thousands of counterfeit items. Weeks later, we joined key government and private sector partners - including several of our nation\\'s largest Internet companies - at a White House summit to discuss ways to curb intellectual property theft and strengthen IP enforcement.', \"In looking back on what's been achieved in recent months, we can all be encouraged. But, as you've discussed here this morning, the fact is that - despite the progress we're seeing and the technological advances we're constantly making - the challenges we face are urgent. And they are increasingly sophisticated.\", 'So, this is no time to become complacent. As President Obama has repeatedly indicated - and as your groundbreaking work has proven - we must, and we will, take our global fight against cyber threats to the next level.', \"Today's summit sends a resounding signal that - together - we can, and will continue to, fight back. And it proves our unwavering commitment to preventing terrorists and other criminals from exploiting the Internet for planning, financing, or executing attacks; to engaging with an expanded network of partners across government and the private sector; and to strengthening our efforts to establish the rule of law in cyberspace.\", \"I'm proud to report that this work is - and it will remain - a top priority not only for me personally, but for our nation's Department of Justice, and for this Administration at the Cabinet level.\", \"Just last month, at the White House, I joined with Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan - and with Secretaries Clinton, Napolitano, and Locke - in announcing a new International Strategy on Cyberspace that will guide our nation's global efforts to prevent and to combat cybercrimes. T  his strategy will allow us to build on the record of progress that's been achieved in recent years - including right here in Indiana. And it will help us ensure that the Internet will continue to provide a forum for open discourse, a marketplace for commercial innovation, and a safe environment for our children to communicate and learn.\", 'But -  especially in this time of growing demands and limited budgets - the fact is that government simply can\\'t do this alone. We must replicate the partnerships you\\'ve established here in the Northern District, and bring even more local and national private sector partners into this work. And we must continue to seek out ways to expand our base of knowledge, to break down traditional \"silos\" of responsibility, and to broaden the range of resources we can bring to bear in this fight.', \"To achieve this, we'll need your help. And we'll continue to rely on your expertise.\", \"From criminal syndicates, to terrorist organizations, to foreign intelligence groups, to disgruntled employees and other malicious intruders, the range of entities that stand ready to execute and exploit cyber attacks has never been greater. But I believe that our commitment to preventing and combating these threats has never been stronger. And, as I look out over this crowd today, I can't help but feel optimistic about what we will achieve together.\", \"Once again, I'd like to thank you for your leadership of - and contributions to - the Justice Department's cyber security efforts. I am grateful to count each of you as partners. I look forward to working with you. And I urge all of you to keep up your great work, as well as the critical dialogue we're beginning today.\", 'Thank you.']\n"

      "[\"Thank you, Bob, for that generous introduction. I'm absolutely delighted to be here today, and to join you all for this important conference. I was told before coming out here that if there was one intellectual property event to attend all year, this was it, so I am truly honored by your invitation, and to be taking part in your Spring Conference.\", \"Over the past two years, I have had the privilege of leading the Criminal Division's nearly 600 lawyers in enforcing the nation's criminal laws. Our prosecutors bring cases in areas ranging from Medicare fraud and money laundering to international narcotics trafficking, gang violence, and public corruption. And, of course, we vigorously prosecute intellectual property crime.\", \"Unlike some of our other priority enforcement areas - drug cartel violence along the Southwest/Mexico border, for example - it is not always obvious to people why we devote as many resources as we do to fighting IP crime. In part, I think that's because of a misperception that IP crimes are victimless, or that the victims of IP crime don't really suffer. Everyone in this room, of course, knows that isn't true. We know that counterfeit pharmaceuticals and other consumer products can cause serious harm to people; and companies whose trade secrets are stolen or whose goods are counterfeited may be forced to downsize or go out of business, costing individuals their jobs. Still, stealing a trade secret feels more abstract to most people than stealing a car. And IP crime is becoming the province of sophisticated, international organized crime groups that are drawn to it because of its perceived low risk and high reward.\", 'These are real challenges for law enforcement. But we are absolutely committed to fighting back, with your help. We are motivated to punish and deter IP crime, and to seek stiff penalties for those we catch. In addition, vigorous IP enforcement helps to promote innovation at home and secure the competitive advantage of the United States in the global economy. As President Obama said last year, we will \"aggressively protect our intellectual property\" because \"[o]ur single greatest asset is the innovation and the ingenuity and creativity of the American people.\"', \"Indeed, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this Administration has made intellectual property enforcement a higher priority than any other Administration in recent memory.\", \"In 2009, President Obama appointed the first U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, or IPEC, Victoria Espinel. We work closely with Ms. Espinel's office on a range of issues, including, perhaps most significantly, the implementation of the Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement, which her office released last June. Among other things, we have worked on a series of legislative recommendations aimed at improving IP enforcement government-wide. These recommendations, which were unveiled in March, include proposals for enhanced criminal penalties for economic espionage and trade secret theft, drug counterfeiting offenses, and other IP crimes. It also recommends creating a felony offense for streaming copyrighted works, and giving law enforcement the authority to seek wiretaps in criminal copyright and trademark cases.\", \"Under Attorney General Holder's leadership, intellectual property enforcement has become a top priority of the Justice Department. In 1999, then-Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder announced the Department's first intellectual property initiative. And in February of last year, as Attorney General, he announced the formation of a new Justice Department Task Force on Intellectual Property, whose mission is to coordinate the Department's overall response to the growing threat of intellectual property crime.\", \"The Department-wide response is multi-faceted. It includes enforcement by the Civil Division, which assists in recovering penalties imposed upon importers of counterfeit goods, and enforces the criminal provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that govern counterfeit drugs and medical devices. It also includes efforts by the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs, which awards grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners to help improve their capacity to address IP crime. As part of its Fiscal Year 2010 Intellectual Property Enforcement Program, Justice Programs awarded approximately $4 million in such grants.\", \"And, of course, the Department's response includes vigorous criminal enforcement. Together with the nation's 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices, the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, or CCIPS, is at the forefront of combating IP crime nationwide.\", \"CCIPS has over 40 highly-specialized prosecutors and computer forensics experts who prosecute multi-district and international cases, and work closely with a network of over 240 specially trained Computer Hacking & Intellectual Property, or CHIP, prosecutors located in U.S. Attorneys' Offices throughout the country.\", 'Together, CCIPS and CHIP prosecutors vigorously investigate and prosecute IP crimes. Already in 2011, we have prosecuted significant cases in each of our key enforcement areas. In March, for example, in the area of trade secret theft, the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the Southern District of New York secured a 97-month sentence for a former computer programmer at the investment bank Goldman Sachs for stealing valuable, proprietary computer code belonging to the bank. During the sentencing proceeding, the district judge remarked that the defendant\\'s conduct was \"audacious - motivated solely by greed, and...characterized by supreme disloyalty to his employer.\" In addition, last month, Mike Yu, a Chinese national and former Ford Motor Company engineer, was sentenced to 70 months in prison for stealing sensitive automotive design documents from Ford in a case prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in the Eastern District of Michigan.', 'In the area of health and safety, we have also been aggressive. In February, for example, in a case by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in the Eastern District of Missouri, defendant Mark Hughes was sentenced to 46 months in prison for illegally importing from China and India, and then selling in the United States, counterfeit Viagra(r) and Cialis(r) pills. We have also continued to build on \"Operation Network Raider,\" an international law enforcement initiative that targets the illegal distribution of counterfeit network hardware manufactured in China. When we announced the operation last year, it had already resulted in 30 felony convictions and more than 700 seizures of counterfeit Cisco network hardware and labels with an estimated retail value of more than $143 million. Indeed, as we speak, CCIPS and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in the Eastern District of Virginia are trying a woman and her former husband for trafficking in counterfeit Cisco goods and labels manufactured in China. The government is also seeking forfeiture of over $1.4 million in this case.', 'In the area of piracy and counterfeiting, we have been equally innovative in our enforcement efforts. On the Monday after Thanksgiving last year - so-called \"Cyber Monday\"- the Attorney General announced a coordinated law enforcement effort known as \"Operation in Our Sights II,\" through which the Criminal Division, the Department of Homeland Security, and nine U.S. Attorneys\\' Offices executed seizure orders against 82 domain names of websites engaged in the sale and distribution of counterfeit goods and illegally copyrighted works. And just two weeks ago, defendant Richard Montejano pleaded guilty for leading a so-called \"warez\" group called Old School Classics, which specialized in the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted music over the Internet from 2002 to 2007.', 'Of course, the problem of IP crime is not confined to our borders. We are acutely aware that it is an international problem as well. We live in a world where new technologies offer almost limitless opportunities for businesses - both large and small - to market and distribute their goods and digital content to consumers around the world. Unfortunately, these same technologies are exploited by individuals and organized criminal enterprises to create high-quality knock-offs and perfect digital copies for global distribution. Trademark counterfeiters often choose to make their illegal goods abroad and then smuggle them for sale into the United States rather than manufacture them here. And websites that offer pirated copies of new or even pre-release movies, music, software, or games often operate overseas. The reason is simple: not every country takes IP enforcement as seriously as we do, or has the expertise to prosecute IP cases effectively.', 'With that in mind, we are working consistently with our foreign law enforcement allies to reduce the global supply of pirated and counterfeit goods, and to strengthen IP enforcement capacity abroad. We do this in several ways. First, through high-visibility outreach: Last October, the Attorney General traveled to China, where he met with senior law enforcement officials, including the Minister of Public Security, to stress the importance of IP enforcement and bilateral cooperation in this area between the United States and China. On the same trip, the Attorney General also spoke at the Fourth Annual International Law Enforcement IP Crime Conference in Hong Kong, where he delivered the message to more than 500 law enforcement and industry representatives from over 40 countries that \"[p]rotecting intellectual property is a top priority for the United States.\"', 'We are also partnering with the State Department to build strong relationships with our law enforcement partners and to provide training to officials from over 20 countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, South and Central America, Africa, and the Middle East, so that they can develop their own IP enforcement capacity. Indeed, over the past five years, Justice Department attorneys have provided training and education on intellectual property enforcement to more than 10,000 prosecutors, investigators, judicial officers, and other officials from around the world. Strengthening the enforcement capacity of other nations not only helps them; it also most definitely assists American enforcement efforts.', \"A cornerstone of our international outreach work is the Department's Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator, or IPLEC, program. Through the IPLEC program, we send experienced federal prosecutors overseas to take the lead on our IP protection efforts in key spots around the globe. These prosecutors work closely with law enforcement authorities abroad to share information and evidence regarding joint investigations and to enhance IP enforcement training programs. We currently have one IPLEC stationed in Bangkok, Thailand, who manages our IP protection efforts in Southeast Asia, and until recently we had a second IPLEC stationed in Sofia, Bulgaria, who was managing our efforts in Eastern Europe.\", 'These prosecutors are critical to our international outreach and enforcement efforts. So much so, in fact, that President Obama has asked Congress, in his 2012 budget request, to fund a new Department program that would place six International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property coordinators, or \"ICHIPs,\" in key locations around the world, to build upon the success of the IPLEC program.', \"As this Administration's, and this Justice Department's, actions make clear, we are serious about IP enforcement. As the head of the Criminal Division, I am personally committed to vigorously enforcing our criminal IP statutes, and bringing trade secret thieves, counterfeiters, intellectual property pirates, and others to justice. But the world of IP crime is vast, and we cannot work alone. What can you, the industry leaders whose intellectual property is at risk, do to help?\", 'The first thing you can do is to continue educating the public about the scourge of IP crime. The perception that IP crime is a \"soft\" crime has a counterproductive effect on our efforts, and we need you to help us educate people about the real consequences of these offenses.', 'Second, we urge you to develop strong internal mechanisms for detecting IP crime with respect to your products and services. We cannot police the entire global economy, and so we absolutely count on you to detect IP crime as it happens. Our partnership with all of you must be strong if we are to make real progress.', 'Finally, let us know what you find. Just as you would report a burglary in your home, we need you to report the theft of your intellectual property. When we learn, in real-time, of IP crime, we can act more effectively and aggressively than if we learn about it long after the fact.', 'IP crime is a serious threat. It jeopardizes the health and safety of consumers. It stifles creativity. And it has a negative effect on the American economy. Attorney General Holder and I and other leaders in the Justice Department are 100 percent committed to aggressive IP enforcement. And we want and need you to work with us in this fight. We face real challenges in this area. But we have taken significant strides in the last two years, and I look forward to expanding on those efforts in the months and years ahead. Thank you.']\n",

      "[\"              WASHINGTON - A federal jury in Baton Rouge, La., today convicted a former research scientist of stealing trade secrets from Dow Chemical Company and selling them to companies in the People's Republic of China, as well as committing perjury, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Donald J. Cazayoux Jr. for the Middle District of Louisiana.  \", '   ', '              After a three-week trial, the jury found Wen Chyu Liu, aka David W. Liou, 74, of Houston, guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft and one count of perjury.', '   ', \"              According to the evidence presented in court, Liou came to the United States from China for graduate work.   He began working for Dow in 1965 and retired in 1992.  Dow is a leading producer of the elastomeric polymer, chlorinated polyethylene (CPE).  Dow's Tyrin CPE is used in a number of applications worldwide, such as automotive and industrial hoses, electrical cable jackets and vinyl siding. \", '   ', \"  While employed at Dow, Liou worked as a research scientist at the company's Plaquemine, La., facility on various aspects of the development and manufacture of Dow elastomers, including Tyrin CPE.  Liou had access to trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information pertaining to Dow's Tyrin CPE process and product technology.    The evidence at trial established that Liou conspired with at least four current and former employees of Dow's facilities in Plaquemine and Stade, Germany, who had worked in Tyrin CPE production, to misappropriate those trade secrets in an effort to develop and market CPE process design packages to various Chinese companies. \", '   ', \"  Liou traveled extensively throughout China to market the stolen information, and evidence introduced at trial showed that he paid current and former Dow employees for Dow's CPE-related material and information.   In one instance, Liou bribed a then-employee at the Plaquemine facility with $50,000 in cash to provide Dow's process manual and other CPE-related information.\", '   ', '  \"Today a federal jury found Mr. Liou guilty of stealing protected trade secrets from Dow Chemical Company, including by bribing fellow employees for this valuable information,\" said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.   \"American industries thrive on innovation and they invest substantial resources in developing new products and technology.  We will not allow individuals to steal the technology and products that U.S. companies have invested years of time and considerable money      to create.\"', '   ', '  \"This office will continue to pursue sophisticated and complex schemes, such as the one perpetrated by this defendant,\" said U.S. Attorney Cazayoux.   \"Such actions undermine the economic viability of our community and our nation, and will not be tolerated.\"', '   ', '   \"Companies within the United States lose millions of dollars to the theft of trade secrets such as this,\" said Special Agent-in-Charge David Welker of the FBI\\'s New Orleans Division. \"The FBI is committed to aggressively identifying and investigating such schemes and along with our partners to bring the perpetrators to justice.\"', '   ', '  In addition, according to evidence presented at trial related to the perjury charge, Liou falsely denied during a deposition that he made arrangements for a co-conspirator to travel to China to meet with representatives of a Chinese company interested in designing and building a new CPE plant.  Liou was under oath at the time of the deposition, which was part of a federal civil suit brought by Dow against Liou.', '   ', '  Liou faces a maximum of 10 years in prison on the conspiracy to commit trade secrets theft charge, and a maximum of five years in prison on the perjury charge.   Each count also carries a maximum fine of $250,000.   A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled.', '         ', \"              The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Corey R.

      "[\"Thank you, Victoria [Espinel]. It's a privilege to join you, Secretary Napolitano, Director Morton - and so many other critical partners - as we kick off today's discussion. And I want to thank you and Andrew [Kline], and the rest of your team, for your work in organizing this event and bringing us all together.\", \"This summit provides a unique and important opportunity to build on the progress that we have achieved over the last year in combating intellectual property crimes and protecting consumer health and safety.  Through the efforts of policymakers and prosecutors, investigators and industry executives, law enforcement officers and consumer advocates, we have taken historic steps forward. The comprehensive strategic plan that the Administration released this past summer is already helping the Department to focus and streamline its enforcement efforts. And the work Victoria and her team are doing to help coordinate the agencies' implementation of that plan has been exemplary. \", 'While I am confident - and encouraged - that we are on the right path, we cannot yet be satisfied. And we must not become complacent.', 'All of us must do more to ensure the health and safety of our citizens, to protect intellectual property rights, to safeguard innovation,  and to combat the growing number of organized criminal networks that profit by peddling counterfeits. We do not have time to waste. And every person in this room has a role to play.', \"Today, when the theft of a single trade secret can destroy a burgeoning small business, America's entrepreneurs and industry leaders are relying on strong IP enforcement. So are American consumers - and American families. When criminals sell counterfeit drugs or medical devices, real patients can pay the price. When knock-off electronic components or other parts make their way into our industrial and military supply chains, real people can get hurt. When profiteers substitute low-quality materials to make bullet-proof vests, it puts real law-enforcement officers in danger. Put simply, when fake goods find their way into our nation's marketplaces - the health and safety of our people can be severely compromised.\", \"Our nation's fight against dangerous counterfeits has never been more critical. But, as you all know, this work has never been more difficult.\", 'The same technologies that spur growth in the legitimate economy also allow criminals to misappropriate the creativity of our innovators and entrepreneurs - and to operate criminal enterprises that profit by selling imitations of legitimate products. ', 'In fact, for every quantum leap we have made technologically or commercially, criminals - and often entire international criminal syndicates - have kept pace. They have developed sophisticated methods for counterfeiting products and trademarks - offenses that can have devastating consequences for individuals, families, and communities. But these crimes - like other thefts of intellectual property - have serious economic consequences as well. They threaten the economic opportunities and financial stability of firms that sell legitimate goods. ', 'They suppress the ingenuity of our people and businesses. And they destroy jobs. ', 'Trafficking in counterfeits is not victimless. And the Justice Department is committed to making sure that it is not seen as a safe business strategy.', \"Through the leadership of the Department's Criminal and Civil Divisions and our U.S. Attorneys' Offices, through the  great work of the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center and with the help of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, the FBI, and many other agency and law enforcement partners - we are succeeding in our efforts to safeguard intellectual property rights, and to protect consumer health and safety.\", 'I am particularly proud of the work we are doing to fight intellectual property crime in the courtroom.', 'Over the last year, the Justice Department has made significant progress in prosecuting individuals and international criminal organizations that traffic in counterfeit goods and pharmaceuticals. ', 'In August, we successfully prosecuted a defendant who was selling fake cancer medications to patients in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The drugs - which he marketed as a rare, experimental treatment - were manufactured in Canada, but advertised and sold globally over the Internet. With assistance from Canadian and German authorities, this individual was apprehended and extradited to the United States. He is now behind bars and has been sentenced to almost three years in prison.', \"This fall  , a jury in Houston, Texas, convicted a defendant of conspiring with people in China to traffic in counterfeit medicine. In this case, our partners in U.S. Customs and Border Patrol discovered more than 6,000 counterfeit pills that were intended for distribution.

The deals, of course, were too good to be true.', 'By seizing these Internet domain names, we disrupted the sale of thousands of counterfeit items. We cut off funds to those seeking to profit from the sale of illegal goods - and willing to exploit the ingenuity of others.

Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney William C. Killian for the Eastern District of Tennessee announced today.', '  After a one-week trial, the jury found Roberts and Howley guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, one count of trade secret theft, one count of unlawful photographing of trade secrets, three counts of transmittal of trade secrets, one count of possession of trade secrets, two counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.', '  \"Unable to create an effective design on their own, these engineers stole trade secrets from a competitor in order to fulfill a contract,\" said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. \"We will not allow the hard work and resources businesses put into product development to be compromised by individuals who unlawfully obtain protected secrets.\"', '  \"The ruling in this case will send a message that complicated trade secret violations will be aggressively investigated and prosecuted by U.S. Attorney\\'s Offices and the Department,\" said U.S. Attorney Killian.', '  According to the evidence presented in court, Wyko secured a $1.2 million contract in early 2007 with the Haohua South China Guilin Rubber Company Limited (HHSC), a Chinese tire manufacturing company located in Guilin, Peoples Republic of China, to supply tire building equipment for use in producing radial \"off the road\" (OTR) tires, which are used on very large earth moving and mining equipment. Wyko was in the business of making tire building equipment for Goodyear and other tire manufacturers. One of the pieces of equipment that Wyko agreed to sell to HHSC was called a swab down device, which is used during the manufacture of a giant OTR tire. However, Wyko had never built a swab down device before and was having difficulty in the spring of 2007 completing their design of the swab down device.', \"  On May 30 and 31, 2007, Roberts and Howley, traveled to a Goodyear tire manufacturing facility located in Topeka, Kan., to service Wyko equipment located in the Goodyear plant with the intention of taking photographs of Goodyear's swab down device to assist them with completing their design even though they knew Goodyear protected the swab down device as a trade secret. On May 31, 2007, the defendants used a cell phone camera to surreptitiously take seven unauthorized photographs of a Goodyear swab down device, without the knowledge or permission of Goodyear. The defendants then emailed the unauthorized photographs to employees at a Wyko subsidiary located in Dudley, England, who used the trade secret information contained in the photographs to complete a similar piece of tire building equipment for the HHSC contract.\", '  The defendants are scheduled to be sentenced on the 10 felony counts by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Phillips on April 14, 2011. The defendants face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each trade secret count, 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count and $2.5 million in fines.', \"  The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Thomas S. Dougherty of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney D.

      "['Remarks as Prepared for Delivery', 'Thank you for hosting me today.  What I want to talk about is malign foreign influence in U.S. elections.  Now this might surprise some people, but 2020 happens to be a federal election year.  So I want to start with some good news, which is that our election infrastructure -- things like our polling places and printed ballots -- have been well-protected and that protection has improved over the last three years.  With regard to the most recent 2018 midterm elections,  DHS and DOJ jointly found no evidence that foreign actors had \"any material impact on the integrity or security of election infrastructure or political/campaign infrastructure used in the 2018 midterm elections for the United States Congress.\"  Likewise, as the Senate Committee on Intelligence has reported, there is no evidence that any vote totals were altered or changed by any foreign actors in the 2016 Presidential election.', \"Watch Deputy Attorney General Rosen's remarks\", 'But interference with infrastructure is not our only concern.  We are also concerned about another threat, known as malign foreign influence.  The key word is \"influence.\"  Much of the time that is disguised propaganda.  Other times, it is using pressure tactics on influential people.  It can also take the form of hacking and disclosing private emails or phone messages.  It comes in many different forms, all designed to influence how Americans think about issues and cast their votes.  There are good lists of these on the FBI and ODNI websites.', \"We cannot escape the reality that the opportunities for malign foreign influence in our elections are far-flung, so it remains a challenge for Americans as voters.  That didn't end in 2016.  But it didn't begin in 2016, either.  Malign foreign influence efforts have been a longstanding concern in American elections, and that historical context can teach us some lessons.  I'd like to use these remarks first to discuss some of this historical context, then to offer a few comparisons with what we've seen more recently, and finally to share a little advice we can borrow from our predecessors.\", 'I think it helps to clarify a few definitions to describe what we mean by \"malign foreign influence,\" as opposed to what we might consider legitimate diplomacy or candid expressions of legitimate national interests that all nations share with each other.  One definition that\\'s easiest to remember is the 3 C\\'s framework: coercive, covert, or corrupt activities by foreign governments to influence U.S. policies, political sentiment, or public discourse, or to interfere in our political processes themselves.  Under this framework, we recognize that foreign governments often have preferences about U.S. policies or the outcomes of our elections.  Sometimes those preferences are expressed openly.  Our government sometimes has open preferences about other countries, too.  When those preferences are open and attributable, no one is deceived or misled. ', 'But we are concerned when those preferences manifest themselves through malign foreign influence activities that are coercive, covert, or corrupt, whether the aim is specifically to influence our elections, or to influence policymaking and public discourse more broadly.', '          Historical Context', \"One thing that has not been much noted in recent years is that malign foreign influence in our elections has been a concern since the Founding of our Republic.  Using the 3C's framework, I want to start with coercive activities. \", 'Going all the way back in 1787, when the Founders were debating the merits of \"our new Constitution,\" Thomas Jefferson told John Adams that he was \"apprehensive of foreign interference, intrigue, influence.\"  Adams too worried that \"as often as elections happen, the danger of foreign influence recurs.\"  Nine years later, the two squared off in the first contested presidential election in American history.', 'The election of 1796 occurred while Britain and revolutionary France were locked in war.  Adams favored the Washington Administration\\'s pro-British trade policy, while Jefferson favored the French Republic.  A few months before the election, in his famous farewell address, President George Washington issued a stern public warning: \"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake ....\" ', 'Nonetheless, France tried to exert its influence.  The French minister to the United States, Pierre-Auguste Adet, told his superiors that he could \"get out the vote for a man devoted to France.\"  He suggested that France should \"adopt measures that will cause the merchants to fear for their property, and to make them see the need to place at the head of the government a man whose known character would inspire confidence in the [French] Republic.\"  On the eve of the election, Adet sent the U.S. Secretary of State a series of letters effectively threatening that France would begin to seize American merchant ships and trigger war unless Jefferson were elected.  Adet had them published in the Philadelphia Aurora, one of the most widely circulated and partisan newspapers of the era.', 'The public threats, however, backfired.  Adams \"suspect[ed] they will have a contrary effect, from what he intended.\"  He was right; Jefferson\\'s confidante James Madison soon reported that Adet\\'s action was an \"electioneering maneuver\" that could risk \"a perpetual alienation\" of the United States and France.  Jefferson\\'s supporters disowned \"this interference\" in the election, while Adams\\' supporters resented it as an attempt to coerce the voters, \"and their exertions against the candidate Mr. Adet was understood to favor were the more determined and the more vigorous.\"  Jefferson ultimately lost by three electoral votes.', 'Adams did not forget the risk that France\\'s attempted coercion posed.  In his inaugural address, he implored the American people never to \"lose sight of the danger\" that foreign influence, whether \"by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality,\" presents to our \"free, fair, virtuous, and independent elections.\"  The next year, Jefferson, too, objected to France\\'s continuing coercive efforts to stir up American partisanship, telling Madison that the efforts were \"very unworthy of a great nation.\"  He felt that they contributed to a mistaken presumption that Jefferson\\'s supporters\\' \"first passion\" was \"an attachment to France, and hatred to\" Adams\\'s party, rather than what American voters\\' passion really was: \"the love of their country.\"', 'Since the twentieth century, as the United States evolved into a superpower, malign foreign influence has been less about coercion and more about deceptive or covert efforts, meaning that the foreign government has tried to disguise or conceal its role.  In the 1930s, Nazi Germany directed an extensive underground effort to influence U.S. public opinion.  One German agent, for example, entered the United States claiming to be a clergyman and used Nazi funds to take over small, established newspapers and civic organizations until he was indicted for failing to register as a foreign agent and fled the country as a fugitive.  Congress responded to these and similar activities by enacting the Foreign Agents Registration Act in 1938, which requires disclosure of foreign influence activities.  The Justice Department successfully prosecuted some of Germany\\'s \"most useful American agents\" who tried to hide their activities.', 'Germany also targeted U.S. elections, including the 1940 election, which occurred while World War II raged in Europe.  Nazi leaders viewed President Franklin Roosevelt as pro-British and interventionist,  so they employed several \"schemes for influencing the outcome of our 1940 Presidential election, as well as the platforms of both major political parties.\"', 'One scheme entailed forging documents and fabricating stories that they hoped would capture the American public\\'s attention.  In March 1940, the Nazis released diplomatic documents they had supposedly recovered from the Polish Foreign Office\\'s archives when they captured Warsaw.  The documents purportedly showed that the Roosevelt Administration had promised aid to Poland before the war and assured Poland that the United States would \"finish\" any war on the Allies\\' side.  Germany\\'s top diplomat in the United States, Hans Thomsen, called the documents a \"bombshell,\" and two members of Congress demanded a congressional investigation.  But most members of Congress and even the American press were more circumspect; they largely followed the advice that President Roosevelt gave when the story broke \"to take all European propaganda at this time with a grain of salt,\" which he immediately amended \"to stretch it to two and then three grains.\"  In the days before the 1940 election, Germany tried to plant another fabricated story claiming evidence that Roosevelt had long been planning to intervene in Europe even before 1939, but no mainstream newspaper would take the bait.', 'After World War II, the Cold War produced a whole new set of challenges from malign foreign influence.  The Soviet Union employed covert or deceptive tactics as part of its so-called \"active measures,\" a phrase it used to describe malign influence activities like disseminating forgeries, disinformation, and propaganda and sponsoring front publications to undermine American interests.  Most active measures were directed abroad, such as when, just a few weeks before the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, the KGB mailed athletes from Africa forged letters supposedly from the Ku Klux Klan with threats against them, or when the Soviets published stories in dozens of Soviet-controlled publications around the world claiming that the AIDS epidemic was started by U.S. military experiments.  But the Soviets also used active measures to undermine public confidence or influence public opinion in the United States, including covertly forging documents and funding conspiracy-mongering books that supposedly tied the FBI and CIA to President Kennedy\\'s assassination or tied FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the Ku Klux Klan.', 'The Soviet Union also targeted U.S. elections.  For example, during the 1976 Democratic primary, the KGB adopted a wide-ranging set of active measures to disparage Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, a known anti-Soviet hawk, by instructing their agents to use confidential contacts to find \"dark spots\" in Jackson\\'s background.  When they did not turn up much, the Soviets sent a forged FBI memorandum dated June 20, 1940 to the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and Jimmy Carter\\'s presidential campaign purportedly concluding that Jackson was secretly gay.  Neither the journalists nor the Carter campaign published the phony document.', \"After the 1980 election, Soviet leaders soon grew to loathe and fear President Reagan's administration, according to an ex-KGB defector, and they ordered the KGB to weaken his 1984 reelection bid.  Intending to discredit President Reagan by portraying him as a McCarthyite, Soviet agents covertly sent American journalists a forged letter, dated October 15, 1947, supposedly from J. Edgar Hoover, that purportedly showed Reagan colluding with the FBI to root out Communists in Hollywood.  The FBI publicly denounced the document when it surfaced in January 1984, explaining that it contained stylistic touches that Hoover would not have tolerated and violated rules for FBI correspondence.   Soviet agents also covertly tried to develop contacts at the Republican and Democratic national party committees to find ways to subvert President Reagan's campaign.  In addition, they developed a package of narratives to disseminate about President Reagan, trying to portray him as a corrupt warmonger who was subservient to the military-industrial complex and responsible for tensions with NATO allies.  But all of the Soviets' efforts failed, and President Reagan was re-elected.\", 'So let me turn to the third \"C\" of malign foreign influence: corrupt measures to influence elections.  One attempt was apparently made in 1968, when, according to, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin,  \"the top Soviet leaders took an extraordinary step, unprecedented in the history of Soviet-American relations,\" and ordered him to offer Vice President and Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey\\'s campaign secret financial aid. But when Dobrynin asked Humphrey about his campaign\\'s financial state, Humphrey replied that it \"was more than enough for him to have Moscow\\'s good wishes,\" and Dobrynin did not formally convey the offer.  Six years later, Congress made it illegal for foreign nationals to make campaign contributions.', 'By the mid-1990\\'s, that again became important when the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC), \"undertook a covert program to influence the U.S. political process through political donations, and other means, during the 1996 election cycle.\"  Over Beijing\\'s strenuous objection, Taiwan\\'s President was granted a visa in 1995 to speak at his alma mater, Cornell University, after Congress passed resolutions supporting the trip.  The PRC then implemented a plan to influence the U.S. political process to be more favorable toward pro-Beijing policies by making campaign donations through middlemen who could provide access to, and seek to influence, candidates and elected officials at all levels of government.  The Justice Department prosecuted a number of the middlemen who were involved, and a 1999 Congressional report identified the PRC conduct as \"a serious threat to our national security.\"', 'And with regard to the 2016 election,  just last week some declassified FBI documents were released by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which indicate that the Clinton campaign was warned about efforts of a foreign government to influence her through campaign contributions that \"may come in a form outside established parameters for such contributions.\"  The threat of corrupt malign influence activities requires continued vigilance.', '          Comparisons with Current Media and Technologies', 'So malign foreign influence efforts in our elections has been a perennial problem.  But though the general threat isn\\'t novel, some of the challenges we\\'re facing now are different.  As President Trump put it in Executive Order 13848: \"In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity...\"', 'Historically, malign influence operations were often limited by their reliance on third parties, such as mainstream news outlets or popular magazines, to reach sizeable segments of the American public.  For much of our history, the media were cautious about being used in this way.  For example, many American journalists wrote exposes about Nazi propaganda in the United States and, at least by 1940, the press was largely \"immune\" to it.  Decades later, the FBI told Congress in 1986 that \"[t]he American media is sophisticated, and generally recognizes Soviet influence attempts.\"  But today, the media environment is considerably different, and the internet and social media also allow foreign actors to reach unprecedented numbers of Americans covertly, inexpensively, and directly, without ever setting foot on U.S. soil.  We are all now familiar with the findings that, in the 2016 election cycle, the Russian Internet Research Agency \"spent a total of about $100,000 over two years on advertisements\" on Facebook to promote social discord and division, and similarly placed disguised posts and tweets on several social media platforms.', 'While the tools of malign influence have proliferated, foreign governments such as Russia and China have also become more sophisticated and more bold.  Back in 1986, the FBI told Congress that Soviet active measures had relatively little success in the United States because they were \"often transparent and sometimes clumsily implemented.\"  Forged government documents, for instance, could be exposed.  But the arsenal of modern malign influence -- like impersonating Americans on social media platforms, or manipulating digital content through \"deep fakes\" -- can be more difficult to detect and counter.  ', 'As to boldness, as the FBI Director has recently pointed out, the PRC has been \"engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign,\" using bribery, blackmail, and other malign tactics to influence our year-round policymaking, which certainly has implications for our elections.  Beijing\\'s corrupt methods are not always as blatant as its illegal campaign financing was in 1996; PRC tactics are more subtly pernicious and complex.  Beijing, for example, works relentlessly to co-opt seemingly independent middlemen who can influence members of Congress on a host of policies. ', \"What is being done about all these malign foreign influence efforts?  Rest assured, as this old problem takes on new looks, the Department of Justice has been responding to these challenges with our own tools.  I'll mention five of them.\", 'First, the FBI has established a Foreign Influence Task Force that brings together cross-disciplinary and cross-regional expertise, encompassing counterintelligence, cyber, criminal, and even counterterrorism agents and analysts who investigate and counter malign influence by China, Russia, Iran, and other foreign actors. ', 'Second, the Department of Justice has been assisting social media companies, campaigns, and election officials in hardening their platforms, networks, and infrastructure against these threats, and has been providing them with defensive counterintelligence briefings and  steps they can undertake to reduce their vulnerabilities.', \"Third, the Department of Justice has strengthened compliance efforts for the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, in order to identify and expose malign foreign influence.  FARA helps to ensure transparency by requiring persons who engage in certain foreign influence-related activities to register with the department and publicly disclose those activities.  It doesn't prohibit any speech, but instead enhances the public's and the government's ability to evaluate foreign influence-related speech by ensuring that the source is clear.\", 'Fourth, where malign foreign influence operations violate our federal laws, as with hacking of email systems to make their contents public, these department of Justice has brought criminal charges.  The department remains prepared to bring criminal charges where they are warranted.', \"Fifth, the department has supported the Administration's broader efforts to counter malign foreign influence.  For example, the Administration has imposed financial sanctions for Russian efforts to sow discord in connection with the 2016 election, and imposed further sanctions in the last twelve months for Russia's additional influence operations since then.  In short, the Justice Department and our colleagues in government have been adapting to foreign actors' malign activities--and actively combatting and defending against them.\", 'The 2020 Landscape', 'At this point, I want to touch briefly on the current threat landscape as we head toward Election Day.  The department of Justice, DHS, and other federal agencies, have engaged in an unprecedented level of coordination with and support to all 50 states and numerous local officials to ensure that their election infrastructure is secure.  We have yet to see any activity intended to prevent voting or to change votes, and we continue to think that it would be extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to change vote tallies.', 'We do, however, continue to see malign foreign influence efforts relevant to the 2020 presidential election.  Some foreign actors are covertly trying to undermine confidence in our elections because they are authoritarian governments opposed to representative democracy.  As the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) recently made public on August 7, some foreign governments have preferences about our election -- and have taken or planned malign activities in support of their preferences -- including efforts by China and Iran to undermine President Trump and his Administration\\'s policies and efforts by Russia to undermine former Vice President Biden.  The Intelligence Community, including the FBI, have briefed Congress, as well as both presidential campaigns, about these threats.  ODNI also has also taken unprecedented steps to educate the public about these threats to \"better inform Americans so they can play a critical role in safeguarding our election.\" ', 'We are working to counter all of these influence activities.  But it is important to remember that there are times when drawing attention to the threats can be precisely what the bad actors want, to generate concern and distrust, division and discord.  And as Americans, we need to avoid the temptation to seek political advantage from the revelation of influence activities that were meant to divide us. ', 'Instead, the right response is for our electorate to be knowledgeable and careful about the sources of information they rely on, to look for accurate information, to inform themselves about the candidates, and to cast their ballots accordingly.  In the words of Thomas Jefferson, \"I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society, but the people themselves.\"  So let me offer some final thoughts about what the historical records tells us that Americans can do to protect ourselves from the malign influence efforts of foreign governments, in addition to the strong measures being taken by the Justice Department and other government agencies.        ', 'Advice from Our Predecessors', 'First, we just need to be aware that malign foreign influence efforts have always existed and they still do.  It\\'s one of the warnings that President George Washington shared when he counseled Americans that \"against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ... the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake.\"', 'Second, this means we should not take information from foreign governments or questionable sources at face value.  Information from countries or regions that have a history of propaganda, should be taken with \"a grain of salt,\" if not \"two and then three grains,\" as President Franklin Roosevelt said.  We\\'ve been warning the public that \"some foreign governments\" have a track record of spreading fabricated stories, disinformation, and propaganda to try to shape voter perceptions, and the Intelligence Community continues to share information about what those governments are doing in 2020.  All Americans can control what information they rely on and can exercise care by evaluating that information with a critical eye.', \"Finally, while we must remain vigilant, Americans should not be deterred from participating in elections by concerns of malign foreign influence efforts.  All Americans, in the end, can control who they vote for. Foreign propaganda and other influence activities have been concerns since the founding of our Republic, but they are challenges that we've been successfully navigating for more than two hundred years.  The measures I've outlined today can help us to do so once again this year.\"]\n",

These grants require the disclosure of significant foreign financial conflicts of interest, including financial support from foreign governments or foreign entities. Unbeknownst to Harvard University beginning in 2011, Lieber became a \"Strategic Scientist\" at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China and was a contractual participant in China\\'s Thousand Talents Plan from in or about 2012 to 2017.

      "[\"Good morning, Professor Dervan, and thank you for that kind introduction.  It is a pleasure to be here today with all of you for the ABA Criminal Justice Section's Third Global White Collar Crime Institute. \", \"I know that significant time and effort has gone into planning and organizing this program, and I sincerely appreciate the invitation to speak today.  I also want to take a moment to recognize two distinguished program participants with whom I'll be sharing a panel after these remarks:  Pavel Zeman, Prosecutor General for the Czech Republic, and Matthew Wagstaff, head of the Bribery and Corruption Division of the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO).\", \"Mr. Prosecutor General--we at the U.S. Department of Justice fully support your country's work on combatting white collar crime, including bribery and corruption.  We commend Czech law enforcement on its investigation of foreign bribery cases and stand ready to assist in any capacity. \", \"We also commend the Czech Republic for its active participation in the OECD's Working Group on Bribery.  In fact, Justice Department colleagues are in Paris this week, together with representatives of the Czech Republic, the UK and many other countries, attending the Working Group on Bribery.  Such meetings are crucial to ensuring that countries work in tandem in the fight against foreign corruption.\", 'Due in part to the efforts of the OECD Working Group on Bribery, we have transitioned from a world in which bribery of foreign officials was considered a business strategy, to one in which bribery is treated like the destructive crime that it is.', \"Mr. Wagstaff, we also very much appreciate our close working relationship with the SFO.  This includes not only collaboration on matters of mutual importance, but also our successful secondment program.  For those who are not aware, since 2016, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has maintained a program with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and SFO that entails seconding a DoJ prosecutor to those agencies in an effort dedicated to enhancing international cooperation.  \", 'The Department of Justice is always looking for new ways to engage with our international colleagues.  I mention these initiatives because they demonstrate the importance of, and our dedication to, collaborative engagement between foreign law enforcement agencies and officials - collaboration that is crucial to the successful investigation and prosecution of transnational crime.', \"In my work as the Department's Deputy Assistant Attorney General overseeing the Criminal Division's Fraud Section, which includes the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the Securities and Financial Fraud Units, I see firsthand the extent to which criminal schemes have grown increasingly transnational. \", 'The attorneys I supervise regularly engage in cross-border investigations, seeking and obtaining evidence from across the globe.  And this applies not just in the FCPA matters that I oversee, but in cases across the Fraud Section and, indeed, the Criminal Division and the Department. ', 'This includes everything from bribery and investment schemes, to computer intrusion and darknet cases, as well as complex money laundering matters.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.', 'Working cooperatively and efficiently with our foreign counterparts is an absolute necessity for effective law enforcement.  Two recent corporate resolutions illustrate the importance of our international law enforcement partners to DoJ investigations. ', 'Earlier this week, the Department announced the resolution of a foreign bribery investigation against TechnipFMC plc (Technip) relating to two separate bribery schemes--one focused on corruptly influencing government officials in Brazil and the other focused on obtaining similar influence in Iraq.  Like so many of our recent corporate resolutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Technip resolution was coordinated in parallel with actions by international law enforcement partners, in this case, authorities in Brazil.  Pursuant to its agreement with the Department, Technip agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of over $296 million.  Notably, DoJ agreed to credit Technip for the amounts it has agreed to pay to settle the parallel Brazilian investigations, which will result in approximately $214 million of the overall U.S. criminal penalty being credited to Brazil.', 'Large international investigations like the one against Technip require more than just the resources of the Department of Justice, acting alone. The governments of Brazil, the United Kingdom, Monaco, Italy, Australia, France and Switzerland provided significant assistance to further the investigation.  The coordinated law enforcement effort in the Technip investigation is far from an outlier.  In fact, it is just the most recent example.  Earlier this year we announced a corporate resolution with Moscow-based Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS), the largest mobile telecommunications company in Russia and an issuer of publicly traded securities in the United States that involved the assistance of law enforcement authorities in over a dozen countries.', 'Solid law enforcement relationships, while vital, are only part of what is needed to successfully confront international corporate misconduct.  We recognize that effective cross-border coordination requires companies, their boards, and executives to trust that they will be treated fairly and not subject to needlessly duplicative penalties that are out of proportion to the misconduct at issue.  To that end, in May of last year the Department implemented a coordinated resolution or \"anti-piling on\" policy to ensure that companies that run afoul of the law are not over-penalized for their misconduct as authorities work to resolve overlapping law enforcement interests.', 'The policy recognizes the need to protect against duplicative punishments, and importantly sends a signal to companies that we will work to avoid such punishments in parallel resolutions.  The policy accomplishes this by directing Department attorneys, where possible, to endeavor to coordinate with other federal, state, local, and/or foreign enforcement authorities seeking to resolve a case with a company for the same misconduct.  This means that not only are we coordinating resolutions and affording credit for penalties paid to other U.S. enforcement agencies, such as to the SEC in the MTS case, but we are also doing so with foreign authorities, where appropriate, just as we did this week with our Brazilian counterparts in the Technip matter. ', \"We are also coordinating with our foreign partners on cases that do not result in a U.S. criminal resolution.  Last year we declined prosecution of Guralp Systems Limited, not only because of the company's voluntary disclosure, remediation and cooperation, but also because Guralp, a U.K. company with its principal place of business in the U.K., was the subject of an ongoing parallel investigation by the SFO for violations of law relating to the same conduct. \", 'I mention the coordinated resolution policy not only to highlight our improved focus on crafting and revising Department policies to focus on transparency and fairness, but also to highlight a fact that I want to stress to all of you - our policies are not just for a domestic audience.', 'For example, in the Criminal Division we recently issued a new guidance document titled, \"Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs.\"', \"The guidance provides a framework for our prosecutors to use when evaluating whether a corporation's compliance program was adequate and effective at the time of suspected misconduct, as well as at the time of a resolution or charging decision.  Importantly, this guidance will be applied not just to U.S. domestic companies, but also to companies globally - and it recognizes the range of compliance challenges confronted by companies across industries, risk profiles, and the globe.\", 'As our prosecutors understand, and the guidance recognizes, compliance is not and cannot be \"one-size-fits-all.\"  We understand that, for instance, international banking compliance is specialized and influenced by different risks and regulatory requirements, just as compliance in the oil exploration and extraction industries is specialized and influenced by a completely different set of risks and regulatory requirements.  We also recognize that those risks and regulatory requirements will differ across the countries in which a company operates.', 'Similarly, just as there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to the evaluation of corporate compliance programs, there is also no one specific model or roadmap for building a compliance infrastructure at a company.  After all, an effective compliance program is broader than the nuts and bolts of a company\\'s compliance department at one point in time. Indeed, the compliance department is not the same thing as a company\\'s compliance program--it is just one functional component of the whole.  ', 'In considering the guidance, it is important to keep in mind what it is and what it is not.  The purpose of the compliance guidance is simply to guide our attorneys as they evaluate corporate compliance programs, no two of which will be exactly alike. ', \"Companies and their advisors need to understand that the compliance guidance is just that, guidance.  In developing and publicizing the guidance, the Criminal Division was not mandating a set of compliance program requirements.  We are not regulators, and it would be impractical in any event to prescribe a universal formula for all companies to follow, regardless of industry, geography, or risk.  Instead of trying to build a compliance program around the guidance, companies and their advisors should instead look to design and enhance compliance programs based around the company's unique risk profile.\", 'We are fully cognizant that a risk-based focus to compliance also includes geographically differentiated risk.  This means that, for example, a company engaged in oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico will likely face, and need to address, different compliance risks from a similar company or subsidiary operating in other parts of the world. ', 'Even in our compliance training efforts, we have tried to be mindful of our law enforcement partners who are often evaluating the adequacy of the same compliance programs as they seek to resolve parallel corporate investigations.  It is for this reason that, when we recently conducted corporate compliance training for our Criminal Division attorneys who engage in corporate enforcement, we invited attorneys from some of our regulatory enforcement partners in the United States and also from foreign enforcement authorities. ', \"Just as the threat of transnational crime and evolving nature of international law impact how companies address risk and compliance, it is also impacting the way we in law enforcement collect evidence.  Virtually every criminal scheme we investigate requires access to electronic evidence, such as the contents of emails and instant messages, and subscriber information.  Our ability to investigate and prosecute international criminal schemes often depends on our ability to collect electronic evidence, wherever it may be located.  However, global companies and their subsidiaries that hold key evidence are often subject to more than one country's laws.  Further complicating matters, data privacy and other restrictions are an evolving area, whether it relates to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, or state secret laws in countries like China.\", \"The number of jurisdictions that have data privacy laws continues to increase.  One country may allow the disclosure of certain evidence by cooperating companies to U.S. law enforcement, but another country's laws may restrict disclosure of that same data. \", 'The FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, the principles of which are applied in corporate enforcement cases across the Criminal Division, addresses this issue by recognizing that there may be instances where a \"company claims that disclosure of overseas documents is prohibited due to data privacy, blocking statutes, or other reasons related to foreign law.\"  We know this presents challenges, but companies must also understand that when we request data that the company claims it is precluded from providing to us, \"the company bears the burden of establishing the prohibition.\"  Therefore, our expectation is that a cooperating company will work to identify all available legal means to provide such evidence and, if the company determines that it is unable to provide such information, we will expect a detailed explanation as to why. ', 'Just as we expect companies and individuals to obey U.S. law, we also will not ask a company to break foreign law.  With that said, we also will not simply accept a blanket assertion of non-disclosure.  As in math class, we will want cooperating companies to show their work to explain the constraints they face and work with us to try to find solutions.', \"We recognize that this takes time and effort.  That is one reason why we clarified the Department's policy on Individual Accountability, also known as the Yates memo.\", 'In November 2018, former Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein announced that under the amended policy, any company seeking cooperation credit in criminal cases must identify relevant facts as to every individual who was \"substantially\" involved in or responsible for the criminal conduct at issue.  This change was made, in part, to reduce the burden on cooperating companies, which prior to the clarification were required to identify and provide evidence relating to \"all\" individuals engaged in wrongdoing in order to receive any cooperation credit.  Through this change, the Department sought to recognize that resolutions should not be delayed merely to collect information about individuals whose involvement was not substantial, and who are not likely to be prosecuted.', 'By focusing on only those \"substantially\" involved in or responsible for wrongdoing, the revised policy also avoids unnecessary expense for cooperating companies, particularly for those dealing with difficult issues relating to the collection and sharing of foreign evidence. ', 'But make no mistake, we remain focused on identifying and holding culpable individuals to account. ', 'Just last week, our prosecutors secured the trial convictions of two defendants for their participation in a scheme to bribe officials of the Republic of Haiti in exchange for business advantages.  In the MTS case I mentioned earlier, we charged a former Uzbek official with conspiracy to commit money laundering, and a former Uzbek executive with various FCPA violations. ', 'We want to encourage companies to develop strong compliance programs, to identify and remediate misconduct, and to come forward and cooperate when violations of the law are identified.  We also want to ensure we are not sending mixed messages or discouraging cooperation because of questions about how cooperating companies will be treated.  We are accomplishing this through an increased focus on transparency--by making clear to the public, companies, and their advisors how we will evaluate corporate enforcement matters across the Criminal Division and the Department.', 'Having represented companies as defense counsel, I know from personal experience the importance of clarity and transparency for companies and their management, boards, and advisors, particularly as it relates to difficult decisions regarding self-disclosure and cooperation.  That is one reason why in cases warranting a declination under the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, we have made our declination letters publicly available.  Those letters lay out our reasoning for issuing the declination, providing increased transparency as to our evaluation process. ', \"However, I also want to stress that there may be instances where a company self-discloses and we decide a public declination is neither necessary nor warranted.  For instance, if a company self-discloses misconduct that was discovered in the context of a merger or acquisition, and we determine that the conduct and financial impact was de minimis, we may be open to a company's request that we not disclose the declination.  And I can assure you that we have done so.  While this will not apply in all situations, and whether we decide to disclose will always be at the discretion of the Department, please know that we are open to discussion.\", 'Of course, the issue where we most often exercise discretion is the decision as to whether to pursue a case in the first instance, particularly where it involves foreign companies and conduct. ', 'While we will always protect American interests and American victims, our role is not to police the world.  For that reason, we will generally pursue international cases that implicate a significant U.S. federal interest.  Exercising this discretion entails consideration of a number of factors, starting with whether the company is based in the United States or is a U.S. issuer.  Equally important is whether there are U.S. victims.  Other factors will include where the misconduct took place, whether U.S. markets were impacted, and whether the U.S. financial system was utilized. ', 'Should we determine that no significant federal interest is at stake, or that the matter is better handled by a foreign authority, as was the case in the Gurlap matter, we may decline prosecution in the United States.', 'At the end of the day, our interest is in reaching fair and reasonable resolutions, not making headlines or extracting financial penalties.', 'While the increasingly transnational aspects of criminal investigations pose new and evolving challenges for prosecutors and our law enforcement partners, our prosecutors and law enforcement agents are up to the challenge.  We also recognize that these same issues also pose challenges for companies and those who represent them. ', \"That is, in part, why we have been working diligently over the past few years to revise and clarify many of the Department's and Criminal Division's policies that impact corporate enforcement, and we will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\", 'I thank you for your time, and look forward to the remainder of the program.']\n",

Claiborne also was required to report any contacts with persons suspected of affiliation with a foreign intelligence agency as well as any gifts she received from foreign sources over a certain amount.', \"Despite such a requirement, Claiborne failed to report repeated contacts with two agents of the People's Republic of China Intelligence Service, even though these agents provided tens of thousands of dollars in gifts and benefits to Claiborne and her family over five years.  The gifts and benefits included cash wired to Claiborne's USAA account, Chinese New Year's gifts, international travel and vacations, tuition at a Chinese fashion school, a fully furnished apartment, a monthly stipend and numerous cash payments.  Some of these gifts and benefits were provided directly to Claiborne, while others were provided to a close family member of Claiborne's.\", 'In exchange for these gifts and benefits, as stated in the plea documents, Claiborne provided copies of internal documents from the State Department on topics ranging from U.S. economic strategies to visits by dignitaries between the two countries. ', 'Claiborne noted in her journal that she could \"Generate 20k in 1 year\" working with one of the PRC agents.  That same agent at one point tasked her with providing internal U.S. Government analyses on a U.S.-Sino Strategic Economic Dialogue that had just concluded.', 'Claiborne, who confided to a co-conspirator that the PRC agents were \"spies,\" willfully misled State Department background investigators and FBI investigators about her contacts with those agents, the plea documents state.  After the State Department and FBI investigators contacted her, Claiborne also instructed her co-conspirators to delete evidence connecting her to the PRC agents.  She was arrested on March 28, 2017, following a law enforcement investigation.', 'Judge Moss scheduled sentencing for July 9, 2019.  Claiborne, of Washington, D.C., was ordered detained pending sentencing, but will self-surrender for said detention on June 5, 2019.  The statutory maximum penalty for a person convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States is five years in prison.  The maximum statutory sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes.  The sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court after considering the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.', \"The FBI's Washington Field Office is leading the investigation into this matter.  The case was prosecuted by Thomas A. Gillice and investigated by John L. Hill, both Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, and Deputy Chief Julie A.

      "['Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. (Lumber Liquidators) has agreed to pay a total penalty of $33 million for filing a materially false and misleading statement to investors regarding the sale of its laminate flooring from China to its customers in the United States.', 'Lumber Liquidators, a public corporation headquartered in Toano, Virginia, and one of the largest retailers of flooring products in the United States, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal information filed today in the Eastern District of Virginia charging the company with securities fraud.  The case was primarily focused on the fact that Lumber Liquidators knowingly filed a false and misleading statement to investors broadly denying the allegations featured in a March 2015 episode of 60 Minutes, and affirming that the company complied with California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations.', \"Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger of the Eastern District of Virginia, Special Agent in Charge David W. Archey of the FBI's Richmond Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Kelly R. Jackson of IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Washington, D.C. Field Office and Inspector in Charge Peter R. Rendina of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Washington Division, made the announcement.\", '\"Lumber Liquidators lied to investors and to the public about its compliance with formaldehyde regulations for the flooring it sold - all to protect its stock price,\" said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.  \"False and misleading financial reports undermine the integrity of our securities markets and harm investors.  The Department and our law enforcement partners are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that those who commit securities fraud are held accountable.\"', '\"This resolution holds Lumber Liquidators accountable for misleading the investing public,\" said U.S. Attorney Terwilliger.  \"It also recognizes that the company has cooperated with the government\\'s investigation, completely replaced its senior executive team, and installed experienced executives who have displayed a commitment to building an ethical corporate culture.  We will continue to ensure that market participants can trust information communicated by public companies when making investment decisions.  My thanks to our prosecutorial team and our investigative partners for their outstanding work on this case.\" ', '\"This penalty should serve as a warning to other corporations who seek to mislead investors,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Archey.  \"FBI Richmond is grateful for the commitment to this case of its partners at the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office, the Justice Department\\'s Fraud Section, the IRS Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\"', '\"Lumber Liquidators knowingly deceived the shareholders they were entrusted to serve,\" said IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Jackson.  \"IRS-CI will continue to work diligently with our federal law enforcement partners to ensure that the punishment for such crimes matches the seriousness of the offense.\"', '\"Those seeking to maximize profits while misleading investors should expect to pay a heavy price,\" said U.S. Postal Inspector in Charge Rendina.  \"The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has investigated these kind of deceptive practices for years to protect investors and the integrity of the market place.  Postal Inspectors work tirelessly to identify and hold accountable any company who uses the U.S. mail to defraud American citizens.\"', \"According to court documents filed as part of the DPA, Lumber Liquidators was subject to various laws that regulated the chemicals used in wood products, including laminate flooring.  Specifically, CARB enforced limits on formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products.  In September 2013, CARB announced that it intended to use deconstructive testing to determine whether finished flooring products contained CARB compliant cores.  In 2013 and 2014, CARB informed Lumber Liquidators that flooring samples collected from its California stores failed deconstructive testing for formaldehyde emissions.  Lumber Liquidators' own deconstructive tests of the same products yielded similar results.\", \"Also in 2014, foreign and domestic flooring suppliers alerted Lumber Liquidators of CARB compliance concerns related to the company's Chinese laminate products.  In February 2014, Lumber Liquidators' Chinese laminate suppliers requested a price increase citing concerns about the increased cost of CARB compliant cores and their ability to pass deconstructive testing for formaldehyde emissions.  Approximately one month later, a U.S. laminate supplier informed Lumber Liquidators that it tested a Chinese laminate sample purchased from one of Lumber Liquidators' stores in the United States and that the sample emitted high levels of formaldehyde.  Lumber Liquidators took only limited steps to determine the validity of the suppliers' concerns, and instead sought to generate support for its position that deconstructive testing was not a valid test method, the company admitted.\", \"To that end, Lumber Liquidators visited two Chinese laminate suppliers in August 2014 to collect and test samples.  While collecting samples from Supplier A, a then-Lumber Liquidators employee noticed a pallet of laminate flooring that factory workers indicated was Lumber Liquidators' product, but the label on the pallet indicated that it contained non-CARB compliant cores.  The former employee took samples from this suspect pallet for testing along with other samples manufactured in his and other employees' presence.  Laboratory A later provided Lumber Liquidators with test results that undermined the company's criticisms of deconstructive testing.  All but one of the products manufactured in front of the Lumber Liquidators employees passed deconstructive testing.  But the samples from the suspect pallet, manufactured before employees arrived, failed deconstructive testing.\", \"Lumber Liquidators representatives again visited Supplier A in September 2014 and January 2015.  Following these visits, Lumber Liquidators concluded that Supplier A had numerous recordkeeping anomalies, refused to implement CARB-related corrective action requests made by the company, and could not reliably demonstrate that its laminate flooring contained CARB compliant cores.  Accordingly, in January 2015, the company's former senior management team decided to discontinue its relationship with Supplier A due to CARB compliance concerns.  Nevertheless, that same day, Lumber Liquidators admitted it ordered more laminate flooring from Supplier A.\", \"In Fall 2014, Lumber Liquidators learned that the CBS news program, 60 Minutes, also retained Laboratory A to conduct deconstructive testing of Lumber Liquidators' products.  Shortly thereafter, Laboratory A secretly notified Lumber Liquidators that the deconstructive tests commissioned by 60 Minutes yielded significant test failures.  The lab then allowed a former Lumber Liquidators employee to review and take pictures of these test results.  In December 2014, the lab owner told former Lumber Liquidators employees that a high deconstructive test failure was a strong indicator that the product was not CARB compliant, the company admitted. \", \"On Feb. 25, 2015, Lumber Liquidators learned that 60 Minutes obtained undercover videos from three of its Chinese laminate suppliers, including Supplier A, in which the suppliers admitted that the laminates they made for Lumber Liquidators were not CARB compliant.  Lumber Liquidators' former senior management team retained outside counsel from Law Firm B to interview the suppliers in the undercover videos.  On Feb. 28, 2015, Law Firm B informed former Lumber Liquidators executives that it recorded one person from each of the three factories in the undercover videos saying that the product they sold Lumber Liquidators was CARB compliant.  Nevertheless, Law Firm B told these former executives that they had limited confidence in the suppliers' statements because, among other things, a former Lumber Liquidators inspector alleged that suppliers offered bribes to him and other company employees, the company admitted.   \", 'On March 1, 2015, 60 Minutes aired a segment alleging that laminate flooring sold by Lumber Liquidators in the United States did not meet CARB emission standards for formaldehyde.  The episode featured the undercover videos and test results previously shown to Lumber Liquidators.', \"The next morning, March 2, 2015, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading of the company's stock, with the expectation that Lumber Liquidators intended to issue a statement responding to the 60 Minutes episode.  Later that morning, Lumber Liquidators, through its employees, knowingly filed a false and misleading Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 8-K broadly denying the allegations in the 60 Minutes episode and affirming Lumber Liquidators complied with CARB regulations, the company admitted.  Specifically, Lumber Liquidators omitted material facts from investors, including CARB's investigation of the company's Chinese laminate products; its own deconstructive test results; the company's decision to discontinue sourcing from Supplier A due to CARB compliance concerns; and evidence that undermined the suppliers' statements that all products provided to Lumber Liquidators were CARB compliant.\", \"Pursuant to its agreement with the Department of Justice, Lumber Liquidators agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $33 million to the United States, including a criminal fine of approximately $19 million, and approximately $14 million in forfeiture.  This amount represents the company's net profits from the sale of 100 percent of its Chinese laminate from approximately Jan. 16, 2015 through May 7, 2015.\", \"Lumber Liquidators also agreed to implement rigorous internal controls and cooperate fully with the Department's ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals.  Under the DPA, prosecution of the company for securities fraud will be deferred for an initial period of three years to allow Lumber Liquidators to demonstrate good conduct.\", 'The SEC announced a separate settlement with Lumber Liquidators in connection with related, parallel proceedings.  Under the terms of its resolution with the SEC, Lumber Liquidators agreed to a total of $6,097,298.42 in disgorgement of profits and prejudgment interest.  The Department of Justice agreed to credit the amount paid to the SEC in disgorgement as part of its agreement.  Thus, the combined total amount of criminal and regulatory penalties paid by Lumber Liquidators will be $33 million.', \"This penalty reflects the nature and seriousness of the conduct, as well as Lumber Liquidators' ongoing cooperation with the United States and the company's extensive efforts at remediation.  Among other remedial efforts, Lumber Liquidators suspended the sale of all laminate flooring from China in May 2015; offered consumers in-home testing for already installed flooring; and implemented new policies and procedures regarding compliance with CARB emission standards and other environmental regulations, sourcing of flooring products, financial reporting and internal controls.  The employees involved in wrongdoing either were terminated or resigned from Lumber Liquidators, and the company replaced its executive management team with experienced executives who have displayed a commitment to building an ethical corporate culture.      \", \"Trial Attorney Cory E. Jacobs of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Katherine Lee Martin and Uzo E. Asonye of the Eastern District of Virginia prosecuted the case. \", \"The Criminal Division's Fraud Section plays a pivotal role in the Department of Justice's fight against white collar crime around the country.\"]\n",

      "['Chairman Marino, Ranking Member Cicilline, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, it is an honor for me to appear before you today on behalf of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.  I want to thank especially Chairman Marino and Ranking Member Cicilline for your support of the efforts of the Antitrust Division to fairly and effectively enforce the antitrust laws.  I appreciate the important role this Committee plays in our constitutional system of checks and balances.  I view my position as the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust as that of a protector of the rights of all American consumers to the fruits of vigorous competition.  When competitive markets function properly, innovators have important incentives to innovate, and disruptors have important incentives to transform markets.  For consumers, dynamic competition produces lower prices and higher quality goods and services.  Free market competition is a bedrock principle of the American economy, and protecting, preserving, and promoting competition through the enforcement of our antitrust laws is a vital function of our government.  I, and all employees of the Antitrust Division, are dedicated to carrying out that mission to the very best of our abilities. ', 'The Antitrust Division has been extraordinarily busy in our daily efforts to protect consumers, workers, and entrepreneurs through sound and vigorous antitrust enforcement and competition advocacy throughout the government.  My testimony today will review our extensive efforts in criminal and civil enforcement and many of our recent new initiatives to promote competition.', \"The following are some highlights of the Division's recent accomplishments and initiatives.\", 'COMPETITION ADVOCACY AND OTHER NEW INITIATIVES:  ', 'CIVIL HIGHLIGHTS:  ', 'CRIMINAL HIGHLIGHTS:', 'INTERNATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:', 'Criminal Enforcement', 'The Division investigated and prosecuted antitrust violations across many sectors of the economy, with over $3.243 billion in criminal fines imposed in FYs 2016-17.  In the most recent fiscal year, the Division investigated and prosecuted individual cases that resulted in the highest number of individuals sentenced to prison terms since 2012.  The Division also has made efforts to increase self-reporting of cartel behavior through its clarification of its amnesty program.', 'Criminal enforcement has long been a vital tool to protect competition and consumers.  The Sherman Act has been a criminal statute ever since it was signed into law in 1890.  Antitrust violations such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation unambiguously disrupt the integrity of the competitive process, harm consumers, and reduce faith in the free market system.  Such harmful agreements among competitors are subject to a rule of per se illegality, and individuals who engage in such conduct appropriately face criminal accountability along with the corporations they serve.  At the Division, we focus our criminal enforcement efforts on holding culpable corporations and individuals accountable, including high-level executives.', 'In an important example, the Division brought charges against and obtained guilty pleas from executives of a generic pharmaceutical company for price fixing, bid rigging, and customer allocation for an antibiotic and a drug used to treat diabetes.  (E.g., Plea Agreement, U.S. v. Glazer, 2:16-cr-00506 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 9, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/931381/download.)  It is particularly galling that, when healthcare prices in the United States are already high, certain corporations and executives engaged in anticompetitive activities at the expense of individuals who depend on critical medications.   ', \"In another area that has a profound impact on American consumers, the Division actively prosecuted bid rigging and fraud relating to real estate foreclosure auctions.  By the end of\\nFY 2018, 138 individuals and 3 companies have been charged as a result of the Division's investigations of bid rigging and fraud relating to real estate foreclosure auctions in California, Alabama, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi.  (E.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Seventh Mississippi Real Estate Investor Pleads Guilty to Conspiring to Rig Bids At Public Foreclosure Auctions (July 19, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seventh-mississippi-real-estate-investor-pleads-guilty-conspiring-rig-bids-public-foreclosure.)  On an individual basis, each of these cases may be relatively small, but on an aggregate basis, these cases and the similar crimes we deter through our enforcement are important to the economy.  Consumers will be protected from investors who subvert competition and line their pockets by illegal bid rigging and fraud while diverting money from the homeowners and mortgage holders entitled to any proceeds.\", 'The Division has many open criminal investigations.  The Division is trying more criminal cases than ever before and obtaining more prison sentences for individuals than in recent years.  Corporate leaders and business executives who consider deviating from the rules of our free enterprise system should take notice. ', 'Moreover, the American public should know that the Antitrust Division is looking out for their salaries, as well.  We have put employers on notice that agreements between employers that eliminate competition for hiring employees in the form of no-hire or non-solicitation agreements (often referred to as \"no-poach\" agreements) are per se violations of the Sherman Act when they are not ancillary to legitimate collaborations.  In October 2016, the Division reminded the business community that no-poach and wage-fixing agreements can be prosecuted as criminal violations when they are not reasonably necessary to a separate, legitimate transaction or collaboration between employers.  As a matter of prosecutorial discretion, the Division will pursue no-poach agreements terminated before October 2016 through civil actions.  Defendants should anticipate potential criminal enforcement actions for any such naked no-poach agreements we uncover that post-date our October 2016 guidance, although we reserve discretion as appropriate in making our ultimate determinations. ', 'The Division will continue to be diligent in detecting and deterring collusion that harms American consumers, and we will remain focused on crucial industries that affect Americans deeply, such as real estate, food, financial services, and health care, just to name a few.', 'Civil Enforcement', \"Our merger review program is perhaps the best known of the Division's many functions, as key mergers generate not only extensive media interest but also typically touch the everyday lives of the American public.  Protecting American consumers and businesses from anticompetitive mergers is an essential element of the Division's mission. \", 'The Division has been confronting huge mergers that cover large swaths of the U.S. economy that touch nearly every consumer, including telecommunications and entertainment (AT&T/Time Warner), agriculture (Bayer/Monsanto, Dow/Dupont), aerospace (UTC/Rockwell), and health care (CVS/Aetna), among many others.  We invest large portions of our limited resources to evaluate these massive transactions to ensure that consumers remain protected and competition is preserved.  As a result, we have been extraordinarily busy in our merger review program. ', \"One prominent example of our efforts on behalf of the American consumer is our review and challenge of AT&T's $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner, one of the largest transactions in U.S. history.  After the matter did not settle, we litigated in the district court for the District of Columbia the first vertical merger case that went to judgment in 40 years.  We have appealed the district court's decision and are proceeding before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on an expedited review schedule.  (Proof Brief of Appellant United States of America, U.S. v. AT&T Inc., No. 18-5214 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1085516/download.)\", \"AT&T/Time Warner is only one of the mega-mergers we have focused on in the past year.  In May, in response to Bayer's proposed $66 billion acquisition of Monsanto, we secured a $9 billion divestiture to protect consumers.  (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. v. Bayer AG & Monsanto Co., No. 1:18- cv-01241 (D.D.C. May 29, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1066681/download.)  Bayer and Monsanto were two of the largest agricultural companies in the world, and they competed to provide farmers with a broad range of seed and crop protection products.  After a thorough investigation, we concluded that the proposed merger would have likely resulted in higher prices, lower quality, and fewer choices to farmers, and ultimately American consumers, across a wide array of seed and crop protection products.  The merger also threatened to stifle the innovation in agricultural technologies that has produced significant benefits to American farmers and consumers.\", 'We were able to negotiate appropriate solutions to those competitive problems, including divestitures to BASF, a global chemical company with a multi-billion-dollar crop protection business.  Through these divestitures, we achieved a robust structural solution that preserves competition from horizontal and vertical concerns raised by the merger.  The settlement also addressed incentives to compete through innovation by requiring divestitures of certain intellectual property and research capabilities.  These innovation-focused divestitures include \"pipeline\" R&D projects and Bayer\\'s nascent \"digital agriculture\" business.  The settlement also reflected important efforts to strengthen the enforceability and effectiveness of our consent decrees.          ', \"In another large agricultural matter, the Division obtained important divestitures associated with Dow's acquisition of DuPont.  (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. & Plaintiff States v. Dow Chemical Co. & E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., No. 1:17-cv-01176 (D.D.C. June 15, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/973951/download.)  The Division's structural remedies were focused on preserving viable, ongoing businesses that preserve needed competition in the agricultural sector.                       \", 'In October, the Division concluded an investigation into the merger of two aerospace businesses, UTC and Rockwell.  The Division required the parties to divest two businesses critical to the safe operation of aircraft in order for the merger to proceed--(a) specialized systems that remove ice from the wing of an aircraft and (b) certain actuators for large aircraft that ensure that the aircraft maintains altitude during flight--so that competition in those markets would be preserved. (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. v. United Technologies Corporation & Rockwell Collins, Inc., No. 1:18-cv-02279-RC (D.D.C. Oct. 10, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1099846/download.)', \"Also in October, we required important divestitures following our investigation into CVS's acquisition of Aetna.  The merger risked anticompetitive effects in Medicare Part D prescription drug plan markets for individuals across twenty-two states, and so the Division required the divestiture of Aetna's Medicare Part D prescription drug plan business for individuals to preserve competition.  (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. et al. v. CVS Health Corporation & Aetna Inc., No. 1:18-cv-02340 (D.D.C. Oct. 10, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1099846/download.)\", \"For the foreseeable future, the Division's merger enforcement activities will continue ahead at full steam.  We continue to vigorously enforce the laws and review pending transactions in order to preserve robust competition for the millions of Americans who rely on private health insurance products.\", 'I would note that these efforts, especially when we pursue litigation against very large mergers, which often involve threats to competition in multiple markets, are resource intensive.  Not only do they require substantial devotion of personnel, but they also require increasingly large outlays for experts and document review.   ', \"Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Antitrust Division staff, we have often been able to resolve large and significant transactions within six months, as illustrated in the recent Disney/Fox and Cigna/Express Scripts investigations.  Nonetheless, doing all we can to modernize and speed up the process of merger review is a worthy goal.  To that end, I recently announced a series of changes in how we approach the merger review process at the Division.  As part of this improved process, we will post a model voluntary request letter and a model timing agreement on our website.  Going forward, we will also make some changes to what we generally agree to in timing agreements.  We will generally seek to collect documents from fewer custodians and to take fewer depositions.  Provided the parties agree to faster and earlier productions, make certain commitments on privilege, and agree to longer post-complaint discovery (if necessary), we will shorten the time from the parties certifying compliance to the Division making a decision to 60 days or less, with the proviso that the responsible deputy can extend that time period if he or she deems it necessary.  With respect to Civil Investigative Demand enforcement, we will bring enforcement actions if necessary to ensure timely and complete compliance.  We are also withdrawing the 2011 Policy Guide to Merger Remedies.  The 2004 Policy Guide to Merger Remedies will be in effect until we release an updated policy.  (Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, It Takes Two: Modernizing the Merger Review Process, Remarks as Prepared for the 2018 Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium (Sept. 25, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/1096326/download.)\", 'In addition to our merger review program, the Division also expends substantial resources investigating and, when appropriate, challenging non-merger conduct that may have the unlawful effect of depriving consumers of the fruits of robust competition.  Some of these conduct issues are straightforward applications of antitrust principles.  For example, the Division has successfully challenged unlawful agreements among South Central Michigan hospitals to not market their services to customers in each other\\'s territories.  In February, following almost three years of litigation, the Division entered into a resolution of its litigation with the last of these hospitals: Henry Ford Allegiance Health (\"Allegiance\"), which operates a 475-bed hospital in Jackson County, Michigan.  (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. & Mich. v. W.A. Foote Mem\\'l Hosp. D/B/A Allegiance Health, No. 5:15-cv-12311 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 27, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1043601/download.)', \"Some of these conduct issues target not everyday consumers, but the U.S. government.  One of the Antitrust Division's top priorities is protecting taxpayer dollars.  On November 14, 2018, three oil companies plead guilty to criminal charges and fines for their involvement in a decade-long bid-rigging conspiracy that targeted contracts to supply fuel to United States Army, Navy, Marine, and Air Force bases in South Korea.  Under Section 4A of the Clayton Act, the Division also civilly pursued treble damages and obtained payments of approximately $150 million in relief. (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. v. GS Caltex Corp. et al., No. 2:18-cv-01456 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 14, 2018), https://www.atrnet.gov/subdocs/2018/359653.pdf.)  Going forward, the Division will continue to ensure that the United States is fully compensated when it is the victim of anticompetitive conduct.\", \"In another conduct case, the Division challenged seven broadcast television companies that had agreed to reciprocally exchange competitively sensitive information relevant to many advertising spot markets. (U.S. v. Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. et al., No. 1:18-cv-02609 (D.D.C. Nov. 13, 2018), https://www.atrnet.gov/subdocs/2018/359602.pdf.)  By exchanging such information, the broadcasters were better able to anticipate their competitors' pricing conduct, which in turn helped inform the stations' own pricing strategies and negotiations with advertisers.  As a result, the information exchanges distorted the normal price-setting mechanism in the spot advertising process and harmed the competitive process.  The Division obtained a settlement agreement from the parties that prohibits the sharing of such competitively sensitive information.\", 'Some conduct issues are complex and require close study for when and how they affect competition and how they should be analyzed under the antitrust laws.  For example, I have given speeches focusing on how policies adopted by a SSO should ensure that a diversity of views are represented, that patent holders have adequate incentives to innovate and create new technologies, and that licensees have appropriate incentives to implement those technologies.  (E.g., Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att\\'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\\'t of Justice, The \"New Madison\" Approach to Antitrust and Intellectual Property Law (Mar. 16, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-keynote-address-university.)  Because SSOs can promote innovation but also provide opportunities for competitors to harm competition, it is critical to examine closely the proper role of antitrust law and take enforcement or advocacy efforts that appropriately maximize incentives for innovation.', \"Along with our specific enforcement actions, the Division continues to pursue policy initiatives to strengthen our civil enforcement program.  One such initiative is to streamline and improve the Division's use of consent decrees and other remedies, guided by the view that antitrust enforcement is law enforcement, not regulation.  (See Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Remarks at the Antitrust Division's Second Roundtable on Competition and Deregulation (Apr. 26, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-antitrust-divisions-second.)  The Division will favor structural relief such as divestitures that rely on free market competitive processes to remedy competitive concerns with a merger rather than behavioral relief that regulates conduct.  Doing so places risks of failure on the merging parties and relies on ongoing mechanisms to enforce settlement terms. \", \"A crucial aspect of a consent decree is the ability to enforce it to ensure that the remedy that was necessary to preserve competition is fully implemented.  In that regard, we have implemented a number of changes in the Division's practices to strengthen our ability to ensure decree compliance.  First, we are now incorporating a set of provisions as standard improvements in our consent decrees that will make decrees more enforceable.  Under these provisions, negotiated with the settling parties, the Division may establish a violation of a consent decree by a preponderance of the evidence (rather than the more exacting clear and convincing evidence standard), thereby using the same standard in a decree violation lawsuit that applies to proving liability in a civil antitrust case in the first instance.\", \"Another of the new provisions permits the government to apply for an extension of a decree's term if the court finds a violation of the decree.  An additional new term requires defendants to reimburse the taxpayers for attorneys' fees, expert fees, and costs incurred in connection with any consent decree enforcement effort.  After a certain number of years, typically five, another new provision gives the Division the ability to terminate a decree upon notice to the court and defendants if it concludes in its discretion the decree is no longer necessary to protect competition.  We are also establishing a new Office of Decree Enforcement in the Division to dedicate Division personnel to ensuring proactive enforcement of consent decrees. \", 'Last, but not least, we are in the midst of a robust effort to review nearly 1,300 so-called \"legacy\" judgments, some of which date back about a century.  Our review considers changes in industry conditions, changes in economics, and changes in law to determine whether these decrees are necessary to protect competition and consumers.  Some of them may be affirmatively harmful to competition.  We have posted for public comment judgments proposed for termination in approximately 60 district courts throughout the country. (Judgment Termination Initiative, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\\'t of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/atr/JudgmentTermination) We have begun the process of filing motions in federal district courts to terminate decrees that are no longer needed to protect competition.  In August, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted our first motion to terminate 19 such judgments.  (Order Terminating Final Judgments, U.S. v.

As part of this effort, we announced our review and invited public comment on the Paramount Consent Decrees, which for over seventy years have regulated how certain movie studios distribute films to movie theatres. (Press Release, U.S. Dep\\'t of Justice, Department of Justice Opens Review of Paramount Consent Decrees (Aug. 2, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-opens-review-paramount-consent-decrees.)  These ongoing efforts will continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary restrictions on individuals and businesses who remain subject to legacy decrees so that we may better focus the Division\\'s resources and attention on protecting competition.   ', 'Policy and Program Initiatives', 'Apart from our direct enforcement efforts, the Division has implemented a wide range of initiatives designed to advance competition both nationally and internationally.  These efforts do not always draw the same interest as our enforcement cases, but can be just as essential, if not more so, to our efforts to protect American consumers and businesses.  I will discuss briefly a few of them.', 'International: Multilateral Framework on Procedures', 'Today, companies must regularly navigate the antitrust and competition enforcement authorities that now exist across the globe.  To promote competition and due process, the United States regularly reaches out to our international counterparts in efforts to harmonize practices around those that best promote competition and to help ensure that competition laws around the world are enforced efficiently, effectively, and fairly.  In June, the United States, in partnership with leading antitrust agencies around the world, advanced an effort to better align with one another on a core set of procedural norms through the Multilateral Framework on Procedures in Competition Law Investigation and Enforcement (or \"MFP\").  (See Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att\\'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\\'t of Justice, Remarks on Global Antitrust Enforcement at the Council on Foreign Relations (June 1, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-global-antitrust-enforcement.)  We are working closely with our international colleagues to achieve consensus on, and publicly commit to, fundamental procedural protections necessary to ensure due process such as non-discrimination, transparency, timely resolution, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, proper notice, opportunity to defend, access to counsel, and judicial review. ', 'Given the complex array of antitrust issues we address with our sister competition agencies across the globe, we are also improving the way we tackle these issues internally.  For example, we established formal internal working groups that incorporate staff from all sections in the Division.  These working groups meet regularly, sometimes with input from outside speakers.  The goal is to learn about new and ongoing international issues, share ideas, discuss best practices, forge consensus, and identify the people and resources that can help address these challenges.', 'Appellate: Amicus Initiative', 'The Division has recently expanded our amicus program to increase our participation in private litigation not only in the Supreme Court, but at the district and appellate courts as well.  In that way, we can more proactively and more effectively promote appropriate use of antitrust and competition principles across the judiciary.  In FY 2018, the Division filed five statements of interest at the district court and seven amicus briefs in the Supreme Court and lower federal appeals courts in cases where the United States is not a party, as compared to just three such amicus briefs in FY 2017.    ', 'Thought Leadership', 'Through workshops and roundtables, the Division provides a forum for industry participants, academics, consumer advocates, and other interested parties to discuss important developments in particular business sectors, the appropriate scope of various legal doctrines, or recent advancements in our understanding of relevant economic principles.', \"On three dates this spring, the Division held a series of public roundtable discussions to explore the relationship between competition and regulation and its implications for antitrust enforcement.  (Public Roundtable Discussion Series on Regulation & Antitrust Law, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/atr/CompReg (last updated June 25, 2018).)  Specific issues included exemptions and immunities from the antitrust laws, the most effective and appropriate scope for consent decrees, and the consumer costs of anticompetitive regulations.  Our speakers spanned a diverse range of policy perspectives and stakeholder viewpoints.  These were fruitful discussions that are already shaping our actions at the Division, such as recent improvements to the Division's consent decree practices.  On November 14, 2018, the Division issued a report, containing the information collected at the hearings, which summarizes the key points of consensus in the roundtable discussions.\", \"In April, the Division hosted a public Roundtable on Criminal Antitrust Compliance to engage with inside and outside corporate counsel, foreign antitrust enforcers, international organization representatives, and other interested stakeholders on the topic of criminal antitrust compliance.  (Public Roundtable on Criminal Antitrust Compliance, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/atr/public-roundtable-antitrust-criminal-compliance (last updated Sept. 10, 2018).)  More than 100 participants attended and discussed the role that antitrust compliance programs play in preventing and detecting criminal antitrust violations, and ways to further promote corporate antitrust compliance.\", \"In June, the Division also held a joint workshop with the FTC on competition in residential real estate brokerage markets.  (Public Workshop: What's New in Residential Real Estate Brokerage Competition, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/atr/events/public-workshop-competition-real-estate (last updated June 25, 2018).)  The workshop drew a diverse array of industry participants, thought leaders, and stakeholders.  This is a sector that has merited recent competition advocacy from the Division to state officials, and the diverse viewpoints from the workshop will inform the Division's advocacy and enforcement efforts going forward.  We continue to closely monitor industry developments and the state of competition.\", 'In addition to workshops and roundtables, the Division has also established the Jackson-Nash Addresses, a new lecture series to inspire and educate Division staff and the public about cutting-edge issues and developments in the field.

Through extraordinary, distinguished guest speakers, we recognize and celebrate the role of economics in advancing the objectives of the antitrust laws and the mission of the Division.  In so doing, the series will honor the weighty contributions to the field of antitrust from former Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson and Nobel laureate economist John Nash.  We are proud that our inaugural address featured Alvin Roth and our second address featured George Akerloff, both Nobel Prize winning economists, who are lauded for important contributions to game theory and markets characterized by asymmetric information, respectively.  Our third address will feature a third Nobel Prize winning economist, Professor Roger Myerson, whose research focuses on the \"revelation principle\" and the development of mechanisms to induce agents to reveal truthfully their private information in contexts, such as through auctions.', 'Looking to the Future', 'It is indeed an exciting time to be at the Antitrust Division as we work to achieve important results for American consumers.  One of the not-so-secret secrets to our success is our talented and devoted staff.  It is critical that the Division continues to attract and retain bright, talented, and passionate individuals--whether they be attorneys, economists, paralegals, or support staff.', \"One way we will draw talent is through the recently established James F. Rill Fellowship Program.  (The James F. Rill Fellowship, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/oarm/james-f-rill-fellowship (last updated Aug. 13, 2018).)  The Fellowship is designed to provide elite candidates of the Honors Program with a special opportunity to participate in antitrust enforcement actions and in the development and implementation of antitrust policy.  I feel fortunate that through this fellowship I can honor one of the greats in the antitrust field, a man whose contributions span public service and private practice, administrations of all stripes, and the field of competition law not just domestically but across the globe.  I hope that the fellowship will draw future great contributors to the field of antitrust.  I look forward to working with this Committee on finding further means to ensure the Antitrust Division has the resources and talent it needs to protect and promote competition.\", 'Conclusion', 'I have been the AAG of the Antitrust Division for a little over one year now, and it has been an exhilarating experience.  I am honored to work with this Committee and to be working with the dedicated women and men of the Antitrust Division to protect American consumers.  We have done much, but much more remains to be done.  I look forward to the coming challenges, knowing the importance of our work.', 'Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.

Xu was extradited to the United States yesterday.\\nThe charges were announced today by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Benjamin C. Glassman, Assistant Director Bill Priestap of the FBI\\'s Counterintelligence Division, and Special Agent in Charge Angela L. Byers of the FBI\\'s Cincinnati Division.\\n\"This indictment alleges that a Chinese intelligence officer sought to steal trade secrets and other sensitive information from an American company that leads the way in aerospace,\" said Assistant Attorney General Demers.  \"This case is not an isolated incident.  It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense.  We cannot tolerate a nation\\'s stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.  We will not tolerate a nation that reaps what it does not sow.\" \\n\"Innovation in aviation has been a hallmark of life and industry in the United States since the Wright brothers first designed gliders in Dayton more than a century ago,\" said U.S. Attorney Glassman.  \"U.S. aerospace companies invest decades of time and billions of dollars in research.  This is the American way.  In contrast, according to the indictment, a Chinese intelligence officer tried to acquire that same, hard-earned innovation through theft.  This case shows that federal law enforcement authorities can not only detect and disrupt such espionage, but can also catch its perpetrators.  The defendant will now face trial in federal court in Cincinnati.\"\\n\"This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government\\'s direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States,\" said Assistant Director Priestap.\\nYanjun Xu is a Deputy Division Director with the MSS\\'s Jiangsu State Security Department, Sixth Bureau.  The MSS is the intelligence and security agency for China and is responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and political security.  MSS has broad powers in China to conduct espionage both domestically and abroad.\\nXu was arrested in Belgium on April 1, pursuant to a federal complaint, and then indicted by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Ohio.  The government unsealed the charges today, following his extradition to the United States.  The four-count indictment charges Xu with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. \\n ', '***', \"According to the indictment:\\nBeginning in at least December 2013 and continuing until his arrest, Xu targeted certain companies inside and outside the United States that are recognized as leaders in the aviation field. This included GE Aviation. He identified experts who worked for these companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise of asking them to deliver a university presentation. Xu and others paid the experts' travel costs and provided stipends.\\n \", '***', \"\\nAn indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed a violation of criminal law and is not evidence of guilt.  Every defendant is presumed innocent until, and unless, proven guilty.\\nThe maximum statutory penalty for conspiracy and attempt to commit economic espionage is 15 years of incarceration.  The maximum for conspiracy and attempt to commit theft of trade secrets is 10 years.  The charges also carry potential financial penalties.  The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes.  If convicted of any offense, a defendant's sentence will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\\nThis investigation was conducted by the FBI's Cincinnati Division, and substantial support was provided by the FBI Legal Attache's Office in Brussels.

      "['Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, it is an honor for me to appear before you today on behalf of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.  I want to thank especially Chairman Lee and Ranking Member Klobuchar for your support of my efforts and those of the Department this past year.  I am humbled by your support of my nomination, and am grateful for your public support of our work at the Antitrust Division to fairly and effectively enforce the antitrust laws.  I appreciate the important role this Committee plays in our constitutional system of checks and balances.  I view my position as the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust as that of a protector of the rights of all American consumers to the fruits of vigorous competition.  Free market competition is a bedrock principle of the American economy, and protecting, preserving and promoting competition through the enforcement of our antitrust laws is a vital function of our government.  I, and all employees of the Antitrust Division, are dedicated to carrying out that mission to the very best of our abilities. ', 'The Antitrust Division has been extraordinarily busy in our daily efforts to protect consumers, workers, and entrepreneurs through sound and vigorous antitrust enforcement and competition advocacy throughout the government.  My testimony today will review our extensive efforts in criminal and civil enforcement and many of our recent new initiatives to promote competition.', \"The following are some highlights of the Division's recent accomplishments and initiatives.\", 'COMPETITION ADVOCACY AND OTHER NEW INITIATIVES:  ', 'CIVIL HIGHLIGHTS:  ', 'CRIMINAL HIGHLIGHTS:', 'INTERNATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:', 'Criminal Enforcement', 'The Division investigated and prosecuted antitrust violations across many sectors of the economy, with over $3.243 billion in criminal fines imposed in FYs 2016-17.  In the most recent fiscal year, the Division investigated and prosecuted individual cases that resulted in the highest number of individuals sentenced to prison terms since 2012.  The Division also has made efforts to increase self-reporting of cartel behavior through its clarification of its amnesty program.', 'Criminal enforcement has long been a vital tool to protect competition and consumers.  The Sherman Act has been a criminal statute ever since it was signed into law in 1890.  Antitrust violations such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation unambiguously disrupt the integrity of the competitive process, harm consumers, and reduce faith in the free market system.  Such harmful agreements among competitors are subject to a rule of per se illegality, and individuals who engage in such conduct appropriately face criminal accountability along with the corporations they serve.  At the Division, we focus our criminal enforcement efforts on holding culpable corporations and individuals accountable, including high-level executives.', 'In an important example, the Division brought charges against and obtained guilty pleas from executives of a generic pharmaceutical company for price fixing, bid rigging, and customer allocation for an antibiotic and a drug used to treat diabetes.  (E.g., Plea Agreement, U.S. v. Glazer, 2:16-cr-00506 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 9, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/931381/download.)  It is particularly galling that, when healthcare prices in the United States are already high, certain corporations and executives engaged in anticompetitive activities at the expense of individuals who depend on critical medications.   ', \"In another area that has a profound impact on American consumers, the Division actively prosecuted bid rigging and fraud relating to real estate foreclosure auctions.  To date, 138 individuals and 3 companies have been charged as a result of the Division's investigations of bid rigging and fraud relating to real estate foreclosure auctions in California, Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi.  (E.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Seventh Mississippi Real Estate Investor Pleads Guilty to Conspiring to Rig Bids At Public Foreclosure Auctions (July 19, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seventh-mississippi-real-estate-investor-pleads-guilty-conspiring-rig-bids-public-foreclosure.)  On an individual basis, each of these cases is relatively small, but on an aggregate basis, these cases are important to the economy, particularly because the convicted investors subverted competition and lined their pockets by illegal bid rigging and fraud while diverting money from the homeowners and mortgage holders entitled to any proceeds.\", 'The Division has many open criminal investigations.  The Division is trying more criminal cases than ever before and obtaining more prison sentences for individuals than in recent years.  Corporate leaders and business executives who consider deviating from the rules of our free enterprise system should take notice. ', 'Moreover, the American public should know that the Antitrust Division is looking out for their salaries, as well.  We have put employers on notice that agreements between employers that eliminate competition for hiring employees in the form of no-hire or non-solicitation agreements (often referred to as \"no-poach\" agreements) are per se violations of the Sherman Act when they are not ancillary to legitimate collaborations.  In October 2016, the Division reminded the business community that no-poach and wage-fixing agreements can be prosecuted as criminal violations when they are not reasonably necessary to a separate, legitimate transaction or collaboration between employers.  As a matter of prosecutorial discretion, the Division will pursue no-poach agreements terminated before October 2016 through civil actions.  Defendants should anticipate potential criminal enforcement actions for any such naked no-poach agreements we uncover that post-date our October 2016 guidance, although we reserve discretion as appropriate in making our ultimate determinations. ', 'The Division will continue to be diligent in detecting and deterring collusion that harms American consumers, and we will remain focused on crucial industries that affect Americans deeply, such as real estate, food, financial services, and health care, just to name a few.', 'Civil Enforcement', \"Our merger review program is perhaps the best known of the Division's many functions, as key mergers generate not only extensive media interest but also typically touch the everyday lives of the American public.  Protecting American consumers and businesses from anticompetitive mergers is an essential element of the Division's mission. \", 'The Division has been confronting huge mergers that cover large swaths of the U.S. economy that touch nearly every consumer, including telecommunications and entertainment (AT&T/Time Warner), agriculture (Bayer/Monsanto, Dow/Dupont), and health care (CVS/Aetna), among many others.  We invest large portions of our limited resources to evaluate these massive transactions to ensure that consumers remain protected and competition is preserved.  As a result, we have been extraordinarily busy in our merger review program. ', \"One prominent example of our efforts on behalf of the American consumer is our review and challenge of AT&T's $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner, one of the largest transactions in U.S. history.  After the matter did not settle, we litigated in the district court for the District of Columbia the first vertical merger case that went to judgment in 40 years.  We have appealed the district court's decision and are proceeding before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on an expedited review schedule.  (Proof Brief of Appellant United States of America, U.S. v. AT&T Inc., No. 18-5214 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1085516/download.)\", \"AT&T/Time Warner is only one of the mega-mergers we have focused on in the past year.  In May, in response to Bayer's proposed $66 billion acquisition of Monsanto, we secured a $9 billion divestiture to protect consumers.  (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. v. Bayer AG & Monsanto Co., No. 1:18- cv-01241 (D.D.C. May 29, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1066681/download.)  Bayer and Monsanto were two of the largest agricultural companies in the world, and they competed to provide farmers with a broad range of seed and crop protection products.  After a thorough investigation, we concluded that the proposed merger would have likely resulted in higher prices, lower quality, and fewer choices to farmers, and ultimately American consumers, across a wide array of seed and crop protection products.  The merger also threatened to stifle the innovation in agricultural technologies that has produced significant benefits to American farmers and consumers.\", 'We were able to negotiate appropriate solutions to those competitive problems, including divestitures to BASF, a global chemical company with a multi-billion-dollar crop protection business.  Through these divestitures, we achieved a robust structural solution that preserves competition from horizontal and vertical concerns raised by the merger.  The settlement also addressed incentives to compete through innovation by requiring divestitures of certain intellectual property and research capabilities.  These innovation-focused divestitures include \"pipeline\" R&D projects and Bayer\\'s nascent \"digital agriculture\" business.  The settlement also reflected important efforts to strengthen the enforceability and effectiveness of our consent decrees.           ', \"In another large agricultural matter, the Division obtained important divestitures associated with Dow's acquisition of DuPont.  (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. & Plaintiff States v. Dow Chemical Co. & E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., No. 1:17-cv-01176 (D.D.C. June 15, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/973951/download.)  The Division's structural remedies were focused on preserving viable, ongoing businesses that preserve needed competition in the agricultural sector.              \", \"For the foreseeable future, the Division's merger enforcement activities will continue ahead at full steam.  We continue to vigorously enforce the laws and review pending transactions in order to preserve robust competition for the millions of Americans who rely on private health insurance products.\", 'I would note that these efforts, especially when we pursue litigation against very large mergers, which often involve threats to competition in multiple markets, are resource intensive.  Not only do they require substantial devotion of personnel, but they also require increasingly large outlays for experts and document review.   ', \"Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Antitrust Division staff, we have often been able to resolve large and significant transactions within six months, as illustrated in the recent Disney/Fox and Cigna/Express Scripts investigations.  Nonetheless, doing all we can to modernize and speed up the process of merger review is a worthy goal.  To that end, I recently announced a series of changes in how we approach the merger review process at the Division.  As part of this improved process, we will post a model voluntary request letter and a model timing agreement on our website.  Going forward, we will also make some changes to what we generally agree to in timing agreements.  We will generally seek to collect documents from fewer custodians and to take fewer depositions.  Provided the parties agree to faster and earlier productions, make certain commitments on privilege, and agree to longer post-complaint discovery (if necessary), we will shorten the time from the parties certifying compliance to the Division making a decision to 60 days or less, with the proviso that the responsible deputy can extend that time period if he or she deems it necessary.  With respect to Civil Investigative Demand enforcement, we will bring enforcement actions if necessary to ensure timely and complete compliance.  We are also withdrawing the 2011 Policy Guide to Merger Remedies.  The 2004 Policy Guide to Merger Remedies will be in effect until we release an updated policy.  (Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, It Takes Two: Modernizing the Merger Review Process, Remarks as Prepared for the 2018 Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium (Sept. 25, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/1096326/download.)\", 'In addition to our merger review program, the Division also expends substantial resources investigating and, when appropriate, challenging non-merger conduct that may have the unlawful effect of depriving consumers of the fruits of robust competition.  Some of these conduct issues are straightforward applications of antitrust principles.  For example, the Division has successfully challenged unlawful agreements among South Central Michigan hospitals to not market their services to customers in each other\\'s territories.  In February, following almost three years of litigation, the Division entered into a resolution of its litigation with the last of these hospitals: Henry Ford Allegiance Health (\"Allegiance\"), which operates a 475-bed hospital in Jackson County, Michigan.  (Competitive Impact Statement, U.S. & Mich. v. W.A. Foote Mem\\'l Hosp. D/B/A Allegiance Health, No. 5:15-cv-12311 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 27, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1043601/download.)   ', 'Some conduct issues are complex and require close study for when and how they affect competition and how they should be analyzed under the antitrust laws.  For example, I have given speeches focusing on how policies adopted by a standards setting organization (SSO) should ensure that a diversity of views are represented, that patent holders have adequate incentives to innovate and create new technologies, and that licensees have appropriate incentives to implement those technologies.  (E.g., Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att\\'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\\'t of Justice, The \"New Madison\" Approach to Antitrust and Intellectual Property Law (Mar. 16, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-keynote-address-university.)  Because SSOs can promote innovation but also provide opportunities for competitors to harm competition, it is critical to examine closely the proper role of antitrust law and take enforcement or advocacy efforts that appropriately maximize incentives for innovation.', \"Along with our specific enforcement actions, the Division continues to pursue policy initiatives to strengthen our civil enforcement program.  One such initiative is to streamline and improve the Division's use of consent decrees and other remedies, guided by the view that antitrust enforcement is law enforcement, not regulation.  (See Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Remarks at the Antitrust Division's Second Roundtable on Competition and Deregulation (Apr. 26, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-antitrust-divisions-second.)  The Division will favor structural relief such as divestitures that rely on free market competitive processes to remedy competitive concerns with a merger rather than behavioral relief that regulates conduct.  Doing so places risks of failure on the merging parties and relies on ongoing mechanisms to enforce settlement terms. \", \"A crucial aspect of a consent decree is the ability to enforce it to ensure that the remedy that was necessary to preserve competition is fully implemented.  In that regard, we have implemented a number of changes in the Division's practices to strengthen our ability to ensure decree compliance.  First, we are now incorporating a set of provisions as standard improvements in our consent decrees that will make decrees more enforceable.  Under these provisions, negotiated with the settling parties, the Division may establish a violation of a consent decree by a preponderance of the evidence (rather than the more exacting clear and convincing evidence standard), thereby using the same standard in a decree violation lawsuit that applies to proving liability in a civil antitrust case in the first instance.\", \"Another of the new provisions permits the government to apply for an extension of a decree's term if the court finds a violation of the decree.  An additional new term requires defendants to reimburse the taxpayers for attorneys' fees, expert fees, and costs incurred in connection with any consent decree enforcement effort.  After a certain number of years, typically five, another new provision gives the Division the ability to terminate a decree upon notice to the court and defendants if it concludes in its discretion the decree is no longer necessary to protect competition.  We are also establishing a new Office of Decree Enforcement in the Division to dedicate Division personnel to ensuring proactive enforcement of consent decrees. \", 'Last, but not least, we are in the midst of a robust effort to review nearly 1,300 so-called \"legacy\" judgments, some of which date back about a century.  Our review considers changes in industry conditions, changes in economics, and changes in law to determine whether these decrees are necessary to protect competition and consumers.  Some of them may be affirmatively harmful to competition.  We have begun the process of filing motions in federal district courts to terminate decrees that are no longer needed to protect competition.  In August, the D.C. District Court granted our first motion to terminate 19 such judgments.  (Order Terminating Final Judgments, U.S. v. American Amusement Ticket Manufacturers Association, 1:18-mc-00091-BAH (D.D.C Aug. 15, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/atr/page/file/1089031/download.) This ongoing effort will continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary restrictions on individuals and businesses who remain subject to legacy decrees so that we may better focus the Division\\'s resources and attention on protecting competition.', \"As part of this effort, we also announced our review of the Paramount Consent Decrees, which for over seventy years have regulated how certain movie studios distribute films to movie theatres.  The public is invited to comment on the Paramount Consent Decrees until the comment period closes tomorrow, October 4.  (Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Department of Justice Opens Review of Paramount Consent Decrees (Aug. 2, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-opens-review-paramount-consent-decrees.) \", 'Policy and Program Initiatives', 'Apart from our direct enforcement efforts, the Division has implemented a wide range of initiatives designed to advance competition both nationally and internationally.  These efforts do not always draw the same interest as our enforcement cases, but can be just as essential, if not more so, to our efforts to protect American consumers and businesses.  I will discuss briefly a few of them.', 'International: Multilateral Framework on Procedures', 'Today, companies must regularly navigate the antitrust and competition enforcement authorities that now exist across the globe.  To promote competition and due process, the United States regularly reaches out to our international counterparts in efforts to harmonize practices around those that best promote competition and to help ensure that competition laws around the world are enforced efficiently, effectively, and fairly.  In June, the United States, in partnership with leading antitrust agencies around the world, advanced an effort to better align with one another on a core set of procedural norms through the Multilateral Framework on Procedures in Competition Law Investigation and Enforcement (or \"MFP\").  (See Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att\\'y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\\'t of Justice, Remarks on Global Antitrust Enforcement at the Council on Foreign Relations (June 1, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-global-antitrust-enforcement.)  We are working closely with our international colleagues to achieve consensus on, and publicly commit to, fundamental procedural protections necessary to ensure due process such as non-discrimination, transparency, timely resolution, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, proper notice, opportunity to defend, access to counsel, and judicial review. ', 'Given the complex array of antitrust issues we address with our sister competition agencies across the globe, we are also improving the way we tackle these issues internally.  For example, we established formal internal working groups that incorporate staff from all sections in the Division.  These working groups meet regularly, sometimes with input from outside speakers.  The goal is to learn about new and ongoing international issues, share ideas, discuss best practices, forge consensus, and identify the people and resources that can help address these challenges.', 'Appellate: Amicus Initiative', 'The Division has recently expanded our amicus program to increase our participation in private litigation not only in the Supreme Court, but at the district and appellate courts as well.  In that way, we can more proactively and more effectively promote appropriate use of antitrust and competition principles across the judiciary.  So far, in 2018, the Division has filed five statements of interest at the district court and five amicus briefs in an appeals court in cases where the United States is not a party, as compared to just two amicus briefs in 2017.         ', 'Thought Leadership', 'Through workshops and roundtables, the Division provides a forum for industry participants, academics, consumer advocates, and other interested parties to discuss important developments in particular business sectors, the appropriate scope of various legal doctrines, or recent advancements in our understanding of relevant economic principles.', \"On three dates this spring, the Division held a series of public roundtable discussions to explore the relationship between competition and regulation and its implications for antitrust enforcement.  (Public Roundtable Discussion Series on Regulation & Antitrust Law, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/atr/CompReg (last updated June 25, 2018).)  Specific issues included exemptions and immunities from the antitrust laws, the most effective and appropriate scope for consent decrees, and the consumer costs of anticompetitive regulations.  Our speakers spanned a diverse range of policy perspectives and stakeholder viewpoints.  These were fruitful discussions that are already shaping our actions at the Division, such as recent improvements to the Division's consent decree practices.\", \"Moreover, in April, the Division hosted a public Roundtable on Criminal Antitrust Compliance to engage with inside and outside corporate counsel, foreign antitrust enforcers, international organization representatives, and other interested stakeholders on the topic of criminal antitrust compliance.  (Public Roundtable on Criminal Antitrust Compliance, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/atr/public-roundtable-antitrust-criminal-compliance (last updated Sept. 10, 2018).)  More than 100 participants attended and discussed the role that antitrust compliance programs play in preventing and detecting criminal antitrust violations, and ways to further promote corporate antitrust compliance.\", \"In June, the Division also held a joint workshop with the FTC on competition in residential real estate brokerage markets.  (Public Workshop: What's New in Residential Real Estate Brokerage Competition, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/atr/events/public-workshop-competition-real-estate (last updated June 25, 2018).)  The workshop drew a diverse array of industry participants, thought leaders, and stakeholders.  This is a sector that has merited recent competition advocacy from the Division to state officials, and the diverse viewpoints from the workshop will inform the Division's advocacy and enforcement efforts going forward.  We continue to closely monitor industry developments and the state of competition.\", 'In addition to workshops and roundtables, the Division has also established the Jackson-Nash Addresses, a new lecture series to inspire and educate Division staff and the public about cutting-edge issues and developments in the field.  (Press Release, U.S. Dep\\'t of Justice, Antitrust Division Establishes the \"Jackson-Nash Address\" and Announces Professor Alvin Roth as Inaugural Speaker (Feb. 8, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/antitrust-division-establishes-jackson-nash-address-and-announces-professor-alvin-roth.)  Through extraordinary, distinguished guest speakers, we recognize and celebrate the role of economics in advancing the objectives of the antitrust laws and the mission of the Division.  In so doing, the series will honor the weighty contributions to the field of antitrust from former Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson and Nobel laureate economist John Nash.  We were proud to have our inaugural address feature Alvin Roth, also a Nobel Prize winning economist, who is lauded for his important contributions to game theory and market design that shaped the way medical students are matched with residency programs and patients are matched with kidney donors.  Our second address featured George Akerloff, another Nobel Prize winning economist, who is lauded for his important contributions to markets characterized by asymmetric information, such as markets for lemons, and John Q. Barrett, a professor of law at St. John\\'s University who is writing a biography on Justice Jackson.', 'Looking to the Future', 'It is indeed an exciting time to be at the Antitrust Division as we work to achieve important results for American consumers.  One of the not-so-secret secrets to our success is our talented and devoted staff.  It is critical that the Division continues to attract and retain bright, talented, and passionate individuals--whether they be attorneys, economists, paralegals, or support staff.', \"One way we will draw talent is through the recently established James F. Rill Fellowship Program.  (The James F. Rill Fellowship, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/oarm/james-f-rill-fellowship (last updated Aug. 13, 2018).)  The Fellowship is designed to provide elite candidates of the Honors Program with a special opportunity to participate in antitrust enforcement actions and in the development and implementation of antitrust policy.  I feel fortunate that through this fellowship I can honor one of the greats in the antitrust field, a man whose contributions span public service and private practice, administrations of all stripes, and the field of competition law not just domestically but across the globe.  I hope that the fellowship will draw future great contributors to the field of antitrust.  I look forward to working with this Committee on finding further means to ensure the Antitrust Division has the resources and talent it needs to protect and promote competition.\", 'Conclusion', 'I have been the AAG of the Antitrust Division for one year and one week now, and it has been an exhilarating experience.  I am honored to have the support of this Committee, and to be working with the dedicated women and men of the Antitrust Division to protect American consumers.  We have done much, but much more remains to be done.  I look forward to the coming challenges, knowing the importance of our work.', 'Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  I look forward to further discussion of these issues.']\n"

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', '\\nThank you Chief De Lucca, for that kind introduction.  Much more importantly, thank you for your more than 30 years of service in law enforcement.  And I\\'m told that your term as President is ending: congratulations on a job well done.  And congratulations to your successor, Lou Dekmar of LaGrange, Georgia.\\nI also want to congratulate the Department of Justice\\'s longest-serving Law Enforcement Coordinator, Didi Nelson of the Atlanta U.S. Attorney\\'s Office, on receiving this year\\'s Human and Civil Rights Award. \\nWhile you\\'re here, I hope you will all get the chance to meet Steve Cook. He is the Director of our Office of Law Enforcement Liaison and an important part of my team to ensure we are serving our law enforcement partners and are growing those relationships.\\nI\\'m told that yesterday you got to hear from FBI Director Christopher Wray about continued ways for his agents and analysts in the field to partner more closely with your intelligence commanders as well. We\\'re all very pleased to have Chris on board.\\nOn behalf of President Trump, it is an honor to be here with you all today - to be with the selfless and courageous men and women of law enforcement.\\nI want to commend the IACP for bringing together more than 30,000 police chiefs from 150 countries to learn from one another and build relationships. \\nIn particular, I want to thank the more than 100 police officers from 15 countries who are here with the Department of Justice\\'s International Criminal Investigative Assistance Program, or ICITAP, with support from the Department of State.   Your work, in partnership with the in-country ICITAP advisors, makes people safer all around the world.  Thank you again.\\nThe threats we face have been growing.  As the criminal element becomes more international, we must as well. That\\'s why conferences like this are exactly what we need.  I have increased DOJ\\'s MLAT personnel and will do more to reduce response time. We will challenge others to do the same.\\nWe are all facing a deadly lucrative international drug trade.  Drugs are killing more Americans than ever before in large part thanks to powerful cartels and international gangs and deadly new synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\\nPerhaps the most brutal of these gangs is MS-13 - which is based in El Salvador, but whose tentacles reach across Central America, Europe, through 40 U.S. States, and to within yards of the U.S. Capitol.\\nWith more than 40,000 members worldwide - including 10,000 in the United States - MS-13 threatens the lives and wellbeing of each and every family everywhere they infest.\\nMS-13 members brutally rape, rob, extort, and murder.  Guided by their motto - \"kill, rape, and control\" - they leave misery, devastation, and death in their wake.\\nBut at the U.S. Department of Justice, we have a motto too: justice for victims and consequences for criminals.  This is our motto and that is our mission.\\nCross-border collaboration is essential. \\nWe\\'ve already achieved some important successes this year.  Just last month, the Department of Justice - along with our partners in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras - announced criminal charges against more than 3,800 gang members operating across the United States and Central America.  This coordinated action, known as Operation Regional Shield, targeted MS-13 and 18th Street gang members and seized their firearms, vehicles, and other assets. \\nBut this work is not finished.  I am announcing today that I have designated MS-13 as a priority for our Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces.  These task forces bring together a broad coalition of our federal prosecutors, DEA, FBI, ATF, ICE, HSI, the IRS, the Department of Labor Inspector General, the Postal Service Inspectors, the Secret Service, the Marshals Service, and the Coast Guard.  And they all have one mission: to go after drug criminals and traffickers at the highest levels. \\nNow they will go after MS-13 with a renewed vigor and a sharpened focus.  I am announcing that I have authorized them to use every lawful tool to investigate MS-13--not just our drug laws, but everything from RICO to our tax laws to our firearms laws.  Just like we took Al Capone off the streets with our tax laws, we will use whatever laws we have to get MS-13 off of our streets.\\nBut MS-13 is not the only target of our international cooperation.\\nIn July, we announced the seizure and take down of AlphaBay-- the largest dark net marketplace takedown in history.  This site hosted more than 200,000 drug sale listings and was responsible for countless synthetic opioid overdoses across the globe, including the tragic death of a 13 year old in Utah. \\nThis takedown was successful because of our close cooperation with our international partners at Europol and in Thailand, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.\\nBut at the Department of Justice, we don\\'t just coordinate between national governments.  We\\'re a federal department, but we also coordinate with state and local law enforcement.  In the United States, 85 percent of law enforcement officers serve at the state and local levels.  We cannot succeed without local police chiefs. \\nBack in February, just weeks after taking office, President Trump issued an executive order that asked DOJ to enhance the protection and safety of our law enforcement.  This is a critical mission for us.  Law enforcement is a noble profession and one that demands respect. \\nI\\'m here today on behalf of President Trump and the Department of Justice to say thank you.  I am proud to stand with you.  The Department of Justice is proud to stand with you.  We have your back.\\nIn addition to his \\'back the blue\\' order, President Trump sent us a second order: reduce crime in America.  His third order was to dismantle transnational criminal organizations.\\nIn order to fulfill these important goals, I changed the charging policy for our federal prosecutors, trusting them once again and directing them to once again charge the most serious, readily provable offense.\\nFurther, I ordered our prosecutors to focus on taking illegal guns off of our streets.  Since then we have seen a 23 percent increase in the number of criminals charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.  That makes all of us safer--but especially the law enforcement officers who are conducting searches and making arrests and going into dangerous situations.  I know that this is a priority for IACP and for police chiefs across America.\\nWe understand our state and local partners are our strongest allies, our greatest resources, and that you deserve our support.\\nThat\\'s why, in July, we reinstituted our adoptive sharing program, ensuring that criminals will not be permitted to profit from their crimes.  As President Trump knows well, civil asset forfeiture is a key tool that helps law enforcement defund organized crime, take back ill-gotten gains, and prevent new crimes from being committed, and it weakens the criminals and the cartels.  In departments across this country, funds that were once used to take lives are now being used to save lives.\\nIACP has been a long-time advocate for this approach, and we\\'re pleased to respond to your priority request.\\nFor the equitable sharing program to be effective, however, we need to maintain public confidence.  That\\'s why last week, I directed Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein to appoint a Director of Asset Forfeiture Accountability to oversee the Department\\'s asset forfeiture program and ensure no errors or overreach.  \\nI want this director to begin work immediately on recommendations like updating the Asset Forfeiture Program\\'s policy guidance. Better asset forfeiture practices will make us more effective and better partners with you.\\nThe Department of Justice also provides help through our grant programs. Today I am announcing that the IACP and several other law enforcement agencies will be receiving awards through the Department\\'s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS.\\nThe IACP will receive more than $200,000 for its Institute for Police and Community Relations, which aims to build trust and cooperation between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We know that any professional department must focus every day on community relations. \\nAdditionally, we will fund $5 million for training across the country to improve rapid responses to active shooter events.  And as I just announced this past weekend, the Department will soon award about $100 million in grants to state and local law enforcement agencies to hire more police officers.\\nThe number of police officers per capita in this country increased steadily from 1992 to 2007.  At the same time, we saw historic decreases in the crime rate.  But from 2007 to 2012, the number of police officers per capita fell by nearly six percent.  Since then, the number of federal prisoners decreased by one-eighth in just three years.\\nNow, we might be tempted to congratulate ourselves on that.  But crime is up.  The murder rate has suddenly jumped by more than 20 percent in the past two years, and the violent crime rate by nearly seven percent.  \\nIt seems to me that we don\\'t have a sentencing problem: we have a crime problem.  Hiring more police can help change that.\\nBut I want to be clear about something.  Our goal is not to fill up the courts or the prisons.  Our goal is to reduce crime, just as President Trump directed us to do.  Our goal is to make every community safer--especially the most vulnerable.\\nThat\\'s why I am also announcing today that several state and local law enforcement agencies will also receive $3 million through the Community Policing Development program. \\nThese awards will help equip our state and local partners with better training, tools, and tactics to fight crime and serve their communities. We know good professional policing works. \\nAnd that\\'s what this is about: serving our communities.  That\\'s why we\\'re here.  Everyone in this room--even though we are from all over the globe--is united in one mission.  Whether you\\'re from Indiana or India--or rural Alabama--we all share the same goal: protecting our families, our cities, and our countries from violence and crime.  And while no two countries or even cities face the same situation, we face many of the same threats and can benefit from many of the same tactics and policies. We truly believe our PSN program just announced will compliment your community police based tactics. \\nTo sum up, let me share a few thoughts.  During my almost 40 years in this work, I have come to understand that we must see our criminal justice system as a whole.  \\nFrom our police officers to our state law enforcement and forensic departments, to our local and state prosecutors, our judges and juries, to our prison system and to our probation and parole officers, we are one system.  Yet, we have different roles, different laws, different lines of authority and different funding sources.  \\nOver the last several decades we have definitely reached higher levels of partnership and collaboration.  One of my highest goals is to continue, even accelerate that cooperation.  \\nWe at the Department of Justice, with our federal partners at the Department of Homeland security and other federal agencies--FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals--fabulously trained agents all--know that there is more we can do together. An arrest of a single drug courier in Columbus, Ohio can lead to a national and international cartel take down. A defendant with prescription drugs in New Hampshire can lead to a corrupt doctor or pharmacist in Miami. With the click of a mouse, a teenager can order fentanyl from China, causing the death of a 13 year old in Utah.  \\nIn many ways our work, supports and facilitates the extension of your cases. \\nI want to thank you all for working together in IACP and for making a commitment to this difficult but noble work.  And I look forward to being your partner to make our countries - and our world - safer places.\\nThank you, and God bless you.']\n",

This year's recipient is Michael J. Nila, the founder of Blue Courage.\", \"Nila is honored for his significant contributions to state and local law enforcement and communities nationwide.  During his law enforcement career, he recognized a significant gap between what we want our country's police officers to be and how the law enforcement profession is currently educating its personnel.  To address this gap, Nila developed Blue Courage, a blend of education, principles, practices, skills and tools that foster a culture of leadership, character and service.  Blue Courage focuses on the heart and mind which represents the foundation to making good decisions and enhancing the capacity to serve honorably.  Today, over 10,000 officers have been trained in Blue Courage and its principles are now infused in recruiting and police academy curricula in four states, with an additional 10 states competing to go through the process.  As a direct result of Blue Courage training, officers are more in tune with and aware of their thoughts and behaviors.  Furthermore, they have tools to become centered and balanced, and are reminded of why they joined the law enforcement profession.  Through Blue Courage, Nila has demonstrated he is a committed and effective partner in the department's efforts to inspire and engage our nation's state and local law enforcement officers, and to strengthen relationships with communities nationwide.\", \"The Edward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrity is presented to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of former Attorney General Edward H.

He has transformed the department's administrative processes through innovative technologies and the recruitment and retention of talented and diverse leadership.  On the financial side, since 2004, Lofthus accomplished a rare feat in that he was able to get clean audits for the department for 12 straight years and for nine straight years, the auditor's report on internal control identified no material weaknesses at the consolidated level.  Lofthus has played a central role in developing budget strategies in direct response to the initiatives of several Attorneys General in the areas of counterterrorism, national security and the administration of justice.  He has provided unmatched leadership in initiatives to provide funding to state and local law enforcement entities throughout the department.  Lofthus is well-known and respected in a variety of public and private arenas, and he is commonly sought out to advise and speak on a variety of challenging government-wide financial and budgetary-based initiatives.\", \"The Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service is the Justice Department's second-highest award for employee performance.

The team, in conjunction with department guidance, drafted ATF's internet investigations policy and established numerous standard operating procedures for ATF's investigative and intelligence footprint online.  The recipients also provided current, pertinent training to law enforcement audiences both inside and outside of ATF.  Through the use of advanced technology, coupled with finely honed analytic and investigative skills, IIC personnel made its mark on illegal firearms transactions on all levels of the internet.  This work was not only commended by partner law enforcement agencies, but the team was also recognized by an illicit Darknet vendor that named ATF specifically as one of the reasons it ceased illegal firearms transactions on its website.\", \"The second Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Division's Litigation III Section, Section Chief David C.

Tessier.\", \"The Antitrust Division's victory against Apple Inc. for orchestrating a conspiracy to raise the prices of e-books represents one of the most significant civil litigation victories that the division has achieved in over a decade, and it has led to state attorneys general and private plaintiffs recovering on behalf of harmed consumers approximately $566 million in damages.  The recipients represented the United States in trial against Apple in June 2013 and successfully defended the case against Apple's appeal.  In April 2010, when Apple launched its iBookstore and entered the e-books market, U.S. e-book prices rose uniformly, in some instances as much as 50 percent.  The division launched an investigation into possible coordination among e-book publishers and Apple and, in April 2012, brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a conspiracy to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  Over the course of the litigation, all the publishers settled with the federal government.  However, Apple aggressively litigated the matter through a three-week trial in June 2013 before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who issued a 160-page order finding Apple liable for orchestrating a scheme among five of the six largest book publishers to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  Apple's vigorous efforts to pursue the matter on appeal ended in March 2016 when the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) rejected Apple's petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuit's decision affirming Judge Cote's order.  The litigation of this action and the precedent created by the trial court's and Second Circuit's decisions should deter those who in the future might contemplate violating U.S. antitrust laws.\", \"The third Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Division's New York Office, Section Chief Jeffrey D.

The investigation uncovered a conspiracy that affected the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate.  These currencies are at the heart of international commerce, and the conspiracy undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of foreign currency exchange markets which account for hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions every day.  The companies responsible for actions that eliminated competition in the marketplace were held accountable for their illegal conduct, which will hopefully deter financial institutions from chasing profits without regard to fairness, the law or the public welfare.\", \"The fourth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Office of the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Solicitor General Eric J.

Hodges, SCOTUS struck down state bans on marriage equality that denied to same-sex couples and their children the protections and benefits of marriage.  In doing so, SCOTUS granted LGBT individuals equal access to marriage and vindicated the Obama Administration's strong interest in the eradication of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  This team is honored for its extraordinary work in this historic case.  Under immense time pressures, the recipients worked collaboratively to craft a compelling, persuasive and successful legal brief on a seminal civil rights issue.  The brief reiterated the department's US v. Windsor position that classifications based on sexual orientation should trigger heightened scrutiny and described the harm that the state bans inflicted on same-sex couples and their families.  In June 2015, SCOTUS issued a powerful decision extending the right to marry to same-sex couples and joining the ranks of landmark civil rights pronouncements from the court. \", \"The fifth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division's Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Deputy Chief Matthew R.

A team of investigators and prosecutors was assembled, and working with their Colombian counterparts, they quickly identified seven individuals responsible for the murder and subsequent destruction of evidence.  In an example of teamwork and coordination at its best, a complaint was filed and arrest warrants were obtained for the suspects within four days of the crime; within 18 months, the defendants' extraditions were secured and they were all convicted.  Because of the diligent work of those assigned to the case, justice was served for the family of Special Agent Watson. \", \"The sixth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Chief Steven J.

By developing and deploying a network investigative technique, with appropriate legal authority, investigators were able to identify members of three websites devoted to child pornography that were operating on an anonymous network.  The investigation required round-the-clock efforts from agents, analysts and prosecutors, and rapid response to fast-breaking developments.  Prosecutors successfully defended these novel investigations in court and have obtained convictions at every turn.  The impact of this investigation cannot be overstated.  It has pioneered investigative work into the dark web that has led to subsequent significant investigations by the Criminal Division and the FBI; the dismantling of more than 100 child exploitation websites; and the seizure of massive amounts of child exploitation material, the largest seizure of virtual currency to date and the discovery of 120 victims of child sexual exploitation.', \"The seventh Distinguished Service Award is presented to Deputy Chief Franz R. Marshall of the Civil Rights Division's Educational Opportunities Section.  Marshall is recognized for his remarkable 43 years of service to the department, virtually all of which has been spent in the Civil Rights Division, where he has dedicated each day to breaking down barriers to educational opportunities for students across the country.  Over the course of his career, he has represented the United States in hundreds of desegregation cases and through this work, Marshall has fiercely protected and embodied a core and founding mission of the Civil Rights Division, dismantling obstacles to opportunity and success in America's public schools.  Furthermore, Marshall has shaped the legal landscape and cleared paths to a better life for countless students.  He has given voice to children and parents in communities throughout the United States, from Native Americans in the Four Corners to African Americans in the Louisiana Bayou.  In short, no department lawyer has done more to open the schoolhouse doors to all children and to fulfill the principles and promise of Brown v.

Under applicable law, the majority of these funds will fuel restoration of natural resources and some economic redevelopment in the Gulf of Mexico region.  The matter is the department's largest-ever environmental enforcement effort.  The team's work also made it possible for the five Gulf states and their local governments to settle their economic damage claims for sums approaching another $5.9 billion.\", \"The ninth Distinguished Service Award is presented to Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle B.

Lauderdale, Florida, law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt & Adler P.A. (RRA).  The basis of the scheme was the sale of securities in which investors purchased the rights to a stream of payments from corporate entities which ostensibly had reached confidential settlements with purported plaintiffs in sexual harassment, employment discrimination and whistleblower cases.  Settlements were available for purchase in amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.  During the operation of the scheme, hundreds of investors remitted more than $1.2 billion to RRA, which funds were utilized to pay previous investors in the scheme to finance a lavish lifestyle for the participants, and to make political and charitable contributions which enhanced the prestige and visibility of RRA, thereby enhancing RRA's ability to attract new investors.  During the ensuing six years of litigation, 29 defendants, including attorneys and public officials, were convicted and sentenced on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax fraud, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, extortion and civil rights violations.  Additionally, through forfeiture proceedings instituted by the government, coupled with proceedings in bankruptcy court and other ancillary civil proceedings, more than $400 million in assets were ultimately recovered, resulting in full restitution to the defrauded investors.\", \"The 10th Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, Assistant U.S. Attorneys John P.

Through his oratorical skills and sophisticated use of the internet, he indoctrinated his young, impressionable followers with his murderous message, inspiring the likes of Richard Reid, Zacarias Moussaoui and Mohammed Siddiqui Kahn.  Additionally, Abu Hamza himself engaged in acts of terror that spanned the globe including the December 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen, which included two U.S. citizens and left four victims dead; the attempt to establish a terrorist training camp for al Qaeda on U.S. soil in late 1999; sending of one of his devoted followers to Afghanistan in 2000 to train and fight with al Qaeda; and supporting the Taliban from 2000 to 2001.  Abu Hamza was arrested in the United Kingdom in 2004, but fought extradition for nearly a decade before he was extradited in October 2012.  In preparing for trial, the recipients analyzed massive volumes of evidence recovered from across the globe, and identified witnesses in multiple continents to build and solidify a criminal case.  The team also engaged in classified and unclassified litigation leading to and during trial, working in close coordination with the U.S. intelligence community to protect national security equities.  Overcoming the inherent challenges in prosecuting a case where the conduct occurred approximately 15 years earlier, and where the evidence and witnesses were spread across the globe, the team secured a conviction on all 11 counts.  Furthermore, Abu Hamza has been permanently incapacitated from future terrorist acts.', \"The 11th Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the FBI's Washington Field Office, Supervisory Special Agent William J.

OSF employs a highly specialized cadre of online covert employees and confidential human sources to detect, target and disrupt WMD threat actors operating in cyberspace.  The operation works to fill a critical detection and intelligence gap by resolving the identity of subjects who have demonstrated the intent and capability to manufacture, distribute or purchase WMD while operating in anonymized, hidden marketplaces and forums devoted to the sale of prohibited items.  OSF team members are subject matter experts in WMD investigations and the innovative use of online undercover techniques designed to pierce the veil of anonymity that most OSF subjects attempt to erect through the use of layered complex encryption and crypto-currency.  To date, OSF has conducted undercover targeting operations in support of 95 FBI investigations, many of which began as a result of OSF intelligence collection.  OSF has been responsible for the disruptions of 18 subjects who attempted to purchase, sell and/or use chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive materials in the United States and across the globe.

Due to their dedication, painstaking work and powerful trial presentation, the recipients did what many thought was impossible by obtaining a conviction in this difficult and wholly circumstantial case.  The team not only proved that Henthorn murdered his second wife but that he had also murdered his first wife some 20 years earlier.  Through the course of hundreds of witness interviews, thousands of hours of work, meticulous analysis of computer forensic evidence, cell tower records and bank records, the team decisively proved that Henthorn carefully planned and executed two cold-blooded murders.

The elimination of parole, use of mandatory minimum sentences, increases in average sentence length over the past three decades and an increase in white collar offenders and sex offenders, among other things, have contributed to the aging federal inmate population.  The recipients were in the field for eight months, interviewing nearly 170 officials and staff from each of the BOP's eight divisions, as well as 13 institutions.  The team conducted site visits of institutions at all security levels, and did extensive document reviews and quantitative analysis spanning a five-year period.  Policies applying to various aspects of the care of aging inmates were numerous and scattered among different program areas.  To overcome limitations in available data, the team conducted wide-ranging quantitative analyses.  The OIG report, issued in May 2015, found that aging inmates are more costly to incarcerate due to increased medical needs, that the physical infrastructure of BOP institutions limits the availability of appropriate housing for aging inmates and that BOP does not provide programming opportunities designed to meet their particular needs.  The report also found that aging inmates engage in fewer misconduct incidents while incarcerated and, based on statistical review, appear to have a lower rate of re-arrest once released.  Beyond merely identifying these issues, the report provided eight concrete recommendations to address them in order to assist BOP in managing its aging inmate population.  After reviewing the report and recommendations, the BOP created formed an interdisciplinary task force to address a number of the recommendations.\", \"The Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service in Indian Country recognizes extraordinary efforts by department employees who demonstrate the department's commitment to fighting crime in Indian Country.

Early investigative techniques revealed the U.S.-based owner and operator of ABN was Alexander Brazhnikov.  Through an exhaustive use of human sources, video surveillance, forensic reconstruction, grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, Title III surveillance of emails and computer analysis, the investigation revealed that ABN was procuring dual-use microelectronics from U.S.-based manufacturers on behalf of Russian companies directly associated with the Russian military and intelligence services.  Moreover, employees of ABN were devaluing the price of exported products to Russia and using front company addresses in Moscow, an offshore virtual private network and an international network of shell companies to conceal the intended end-users from U.S. law enforcement.  The investigative team worked diligently to overcome each of these obfuscation techniques to ultimately reveal the totality of Brazhnikov's criminal offenses.  As a result of the investigation, in June 2014, an arrest warrant for Brazhnikov was issued for his illegal smuggling of export controlled U.S.-sourced goods to Russia and for conducting $65 million in money laundering.  In June 2015, Brazhnikov pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle goods from the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.  Brazhnikov also admitted to smuggling microelectronics to Russian defense contractors known to supply the Russian military and intelligence services, to include two Russian nuclear warhead design institutes.  As a result of his guilty plea, the District Court of New Jersey issued a money judgment against Brazhnikov for $65 million.\", \"The Attorney General's Award for Excellence in Management recognizes outstanding administrative or managerial achievements which have significantly improved operations or productivity, or reduced costs.

Recently, Woods was assigned a very high-profile and large-scale FOIA media request seeking information regarding use of government funds for commemorative and recognition items within both USMS headquarters and each of its 94 districts.  Because of the breadth of the possible records and the effort required to capture all responsive information, Woods spent hundreds of hours in conversation with USMS district and division personnel conducting the searches and explaining the type of information to be included in responses.  In addition, the request required coordination and consultation with other department components.  Following her review of over 15,000 pages of documents, Woods created a custom spreadsheet in order to display the responsive information in a form which the requester could clearly understand.

Glass and Lisa A. Scanlon; and Trial Attorneys Steven B. Kramer, Kelsey W. Shannon and Jeffrey G. Vernon.  The Antitrust Division's high-profile victory at trial blocking General Electric's (GE) attempt to sell its appliances business to Electrolux represents one of the most significant merger trial victories the division has achieved in decades, and has directly helped tens of millions of U.S. consumers who purchase appliances each year.  On July 1, 2015, the United States brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against GE and Electrolux, alleging that their proposed merger would raise appliance prices.  In November 2015, trial began in before U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia.  During a five-week, highly publicized trial, the trial team made its case largely through the documents and adverse testimony of GE and Electrolux, uncooperative competitors and economic analysis, demonstrating that the merger would have a significant effect on the prices of ranges, cooktops and wall ovens.  One day before trial was to conclude, GE abandoned the proposed merger and as a result, U.S. consumers will be able to save hundreds of millions of dollars.\", \"The second John Marshall Award for Trial of Litigation is presented to the team responsible for the prosecution and conviction of Jeffrey Sterling.  As a result of their tireless efforts over the course of several years, Sterling was found guilty of unauthorized disclosures of classified information vital to national security in the first Espionage Act trial of its kind in decades.  The successful outcome was the result of over four years of complex pre-trial litigation involving classified information, covert witnesses, First Amendment issues and media subpoenas.  At trial, the prosecutors proved that Sterling, a former CIA officer, disclosed to a journalist the details of an extremely sensitive, valuable and classified clandestine operation designed to undermine the Iranian nuclear weapons program.  Sterling's crime not only undermined a valuable tool to attack Iran's nuclear program, but also endangered the lives of an important human asset and his family.  The defendant's unlawful disclosures put lives at risk and constituted an egregious breach of the public trust.  Sterling was sentenced to 42 months in prison.  This case demonstrates the perseverance, tenacity and commitment of the prosecution team in overcoming formidable challenges in bringing this uniquely complex case to trial in the interests of justice and national security.

This team is honored for its extraordinary work in securing - alongside private plaintiffs - the landmark settlement agreement remedying systemic discrimination in Oregon's employment service system for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD).  Through the team's outstanding oral and written advocacy, a groundbreaking settlement was achieved in Lane v. Brown, the nation's first class-action lawsuit to challenge a state funded and administered employment service system, relying primarily on sheltered workshops, as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) integration mandate.  Throughout the more than three-year litigation, the team demonstrated exemplary dedication, as well as outstanding advocacy and strategy, that successfully positioned the department and private plaintiffs to obtain a comprehensive settlement agreement providing relief to approximately 7,000 people with I/DD.  These individuals include 1,115 adults with I/DD, who have been relegated for far too long in segregated sheltered workshops when they were able and wanted to work in real jobs in the community, and roughly 4,900 youth with I/DD who will now receive employment services to choose, prepare for, get and keep jobs in a typical setting.

Eshkenazi and Jeffrey K. Powell of the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the Southern District of New York.  As a result of the extraordinary work of the recipients, New York City\\'s jail system is now subject to sweeping court-ordered reforms to counter the pervasive culture of violence that has plagued it for decades and has inflicted tremendous harm on inmates and correction officers alike.  After its rigorous investigation into the treatment of adolescent inmates on Rikers Island, the team drafted a scathing 79-page report that concluded that male inmates between the ages of 16 and 18 were subject to rampant use of unnecessary and excessive force by correction staff, were not being adequately protected from violence inflicted by other inmates, and were being placed in punitive segregation for weeks or months at a time at an alarming rate.  To force desperately needed reforms, the Southern District of New York intervened in an ongoing class action alleging a system-wide pattern and practice of excessive force.  The recipients led the parties through many months of difficult negotiations which resulted in a groundbreaking consent decree requiring comprehensive and innovative reform designed to end the unconstitutional violence on Rikers Island.  The consent decree also prohibits the use of punitive segregation for inmates under the age of 18.  In approving the settlement, the district court judge described the agreement as \"the product of unprecedented analysis, investigation, collaboration, commitment to the protection of rights and vision for systemic reform,\" and noted that it \"provides an important example for other correctional systems throughout the country.\"', \"The first John Marshall Award for Support of Litigation is presented to Assistant Director Reginald T.

In this role, the team provides all aspects of legal assistance including counsel to eight federal agencies; legal review of agency actions in advance of litigation; marshalling expert witness resources and testimony; researching and drafting extensive legal briefs; coordinating positions among the various federal agencies; and representing the agencies in the courtroom.  The cases are complex, controversial and often high-profile.  Due to its work, the team has secured litigation outcomes allowing critical hydroelectric and navigation projects to move forward while protecting the needs of salmon.  Their efforts have also resulted in significant improvement of federal and tribal relations.  The awardees are, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division's Wildlife and Marine Resources Section, Senior Trial Attorneys Michael R. Eitel and Carter H. Howell and Trial Attorney Andrea E. Gelatt; and from the Environment and Natural Resources Division's Natural Resources Section, Senior Trial Attorneys Romney S. Philpott III and Kristofor R. Swanson.\", \"The John Marshall Award for Handling of Appeals is presented to Trial Attorney Arthur T. Catterall of the Tax Division's Appellate Section.  Catterall is recognized for his exceptional work as an appellate advocate in tackling some of the most difficult civil tax cases to come before the Courts of Appeals in recent years, including tax shelter cases combining complex factual patterns with thorny issues of statutory interpretation.  His collaborative work with trial and agency counsel, and his clear and eloquent arguments on behalf of the federal government, have exposed the fallacies at the heart of various abusive tax shelters and have contributed to the government's victory in the SCOTUS case US v. Gary Woods, allowing for the imposition of accuracy-related penalties in transactions lacking economic substance.  His work has saved and will continue to save the government hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, and has contributed to the development of the law in a manner that enhances the integrity and fairness of the federal tax system.\", \"The John Marshall Award for Providing Legal Advice is presented to the team responsible for in reviewing executive orders and attorney general orders for form and legality.  Together, the recipients ensure that the orders are lawful and presented in proper form.  They perform this daunting and critical task with supreme skill, integrity and care, and frequently on an extremely short timeline.  Moreover, the team's behind-the-scenes work is critical to the integrity and success of every order the President of the United States or Attorney General signs.  The recipients are, from the Office of Legal Counsel, Special Counsel Rosemary A. Hart, Senior Counsel Matthew D. Roberts and Attorney-Advisers Martine E. Cicconi, Kirti Datla, Nathan A. Forrester, Laura E. Heim, KelleyBrooke Hostetler, Jane E. Nitze, Annie L. Owens, Mitchell Reich and Jonathan D. Shaub.\", \"This year's John Marshall Award for Asset Forfeiture is presented to, from the Criminal Division's Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, Deputy Chief Woo S. Lee and Trial Attorney Della Sentilles; from the Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs, Trial Attorneys Frances Chang and Michael J. Surgalla Jr.; from the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph F. Minni and J. Alvin Stout III; and from the U.S. Attorney's Office Central District of California, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Katharine Schonbachler and Steven R. Welk.\", \"This team is honored for its contributions to the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative through its civil forfeiture of bribe proceeds paid to the former President of the Republic of Korea, Chun Doo Hwan.  After seizing power in 1979, Chun went on to earn a salary of approximately $20,000 per year from 1980 through 1988.  When he was ultimately convicted of corruption crimes by South Korea in 1997, the trial court established that Chun had received more than $200 million in bribes during his presidency and ordered him to pay restitution in that amount.  Stymied in their efforts to collect on Chun's restitution order, in 2013, Korean prosecutors turned to the department for assistance.  Undaunted by the age of the evidence, the team pieced together financial and testimonial evidence sufficient to show that a portion of Chun's bribe proceeds were paid through intermediaries, transferred out of Korea in the names of shell corporations and ultimately invested into various properties in the United States.  On Nov. 9, 2015, Attorney General Lynch celebrated the successful conclusion of this case by presenting the Korean Minister of Justice with an embossed copy of a forfeiture order and congratulating South Korea on having recovered more than $28.7 million as a result of the team's efforts.\", \"This year's John Marshall Award for Alternative Dispute Resolution is presented to the Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Team for the negotiation, defense and implementation of a settlement between the state of Montana, the Crow Nation and the United States that confirms the federal water rights of the Crow Nation arising from its 1868 treaty.  The settlement, a decades-long effort, brings much-needed water, infrastructure and economic development to the Crow Reservation in Montana and allows the tribe to thrive on its reservation.  The awardees are recognized for their creative and exemplary work in developing, negotiating and implementing a settlement approved by the Montana Legislature and subsequently ratified and altered by Congress.  The team then defended the settlement in state and federal courts.  Their work began with the negotiation of an agreement in the late 1990s, resolving contentious water rights issues as well as mineral severance taxation issues heard by SCOTUS.  The team's successful completion of this extraordinary process makes clean drinking water, improved irrigation facilities and economic development opportunities available on the Crow Indian Reservation and confirms promises made to the Crow Nation in 1868.\", \"The awardees are, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division's Indian Resources Section, Section Chief S. Craig Alexander, Assistant Section Chief David W. Harder and Trial Attorney J. Nathanael Watson; from the division's Law and Policy Section, Attorney-Advisor Stacy R. Stoller; from the division's Natural Resources Section, Trial Attorney Tyler G. Bair; and from the division's Appellate Section Trial Attorney John L. Smeltzer.\", \"The Attorney General's Award for Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee recognizes exceptional performance and notable accomplishments towards the department's mission by an employee with fewer than five years of federal career service. \", \"The first Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented to Criminal Division Appellate Section Attorney Ross B. Goldman.  Goldman has proven himself to be an extraordinary and productive appellate advocate, who masterfully handles complex, large-record appeals.  Although his cases have run the gamut from street crime to securities fraud, Goldman has brought his sophisticated analysis to two areas that bedevil the courts and prosecutors; insider trading, where he drafted a SCOTUS merits brief and a certiorari petition, and extraterritoriality, where, in one case, he defended the murder conviction of a Colombian national who murdered a DEA agent in Bogota and, in a second case, assisted the Solicitor General in formulating arguments on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act's extraterritorial reach.  He not only volunteers to take on extra work within the division, but he also seized the opportunity to review commutation applications filed by convicted drug traffickers because he believes so strongly in the Obama Administration's initiative to provide relief to nonviolent offenders who have already served significant prison terms.  Finally, Goldman serves on the division's Diversity Committee and mentors a minority law student.  He understands the department's mission writ large and he gives his best at all times.\", \"The second Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented to Special Agent Adebowale Babarinde Alade of the FBI's San Antonio Field Office.  Alade was the lead investigator on a 32-month complex criminal investigation targeting the Almighty Latin King Nation (ALKN), a violent transnational criminal enterprise operating in Texas with connections across the United States and overseas.  With less than one year in the FBI, and still serving as a probationary agent, Alade demonstrated exceptional initiative by carefully exploiting human source information in early 2013, resulting in the identification of a key leader of the ALKN with control over operations in Texas.  He determined that the ALKN was importing and distributing large quantities of narcotics from Mexico-based cartels, and was also involved in weapons trafficking with access to military-grade weapons and grenades.  After obtaining Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces designation, Alade relentlessly pursued ALKN's illicit activities, ultimately targeting its command and control structure through the use of sophisticated techniques involving the interception of communications through Title III court orders.  During 2014, Alade exploited intelligence derived from ALKN communications and human sources, and developed a cohesive interagency team by sharing information with law enforcement partners, resulting in a collaborative effort to target the ALKN.  In October 2015, his work resulted in the indictment of 48 members of the ALKN, including its entire leadership structure in Texas, on RICO Act and drug conspiracy charges, as well as state drug violations.  Alade subsequently led the multiagency enforcement operation that disrupted the ALKN, resulting in the seizure of narcotics and firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition, cash, body armor, extensive digital devices and a wide array of ALKN paraphernalia.  In conducting this investigation, Alade directly supported the department's mission by ensuring public safety against domestic and foreign threats, as well as providing leadership in preventing and controlling crime.\"]\n"

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Thank you for that introduction, and for the opportunity to be a part of this important discussion. ', 'As you all know, foreign governments and other non-state adversaries of the United States are engaged in an aggressive campaign to evade U.S. sanctions regimes and acquire sensitive U.S. technology.  In so doing, they threaten our economy, our prosperity and, most importantly, our national security.  Disrupting these national security threats is among the highest priorities of the Department of Justice, and the National Security Division. ', 'But the responsibility of protecting our nation from these threats is a shared one.  Your clients - the companies you represent - and thus, you, have a critical role to play. ', \"Because our companies have our nation's crown jewels in their possession.  They house information targeted by thieves ranging from foreign powers bent on economic and military superiority, to individual criminals who know the market demand for this information, to terrorists who wish to create weapons of mass destruction. \", 'Of course, companies have a responsibility to comply with the export control and sanctions regime.  We must also recognize that our companies are not immune from becoming unwitting victims of thieves and spies.  We live in an age where the threats we face are not limited to unlawful shipments and deliveries of goods.  Threats are also posed by insiders and through cyberspace.  Therefore, to protect what we value, our national assets, companies must learn how to comply with the law and how to protect themselves. ', 'That is why it is good to see such a strong turnout.  Lawyers are on the front line helping clients adapt to an ever evolving export control regime.  Lawyers shape strategy - hardening collective defenses and counseling companies on best practices. ', 'For example, sitting here today, you know to help your clients comply with export controls and sanctions.   Regimes designed to keep export controlled data and trade secrets out of the hands of rogue nations or terrorists.', 'But have you had the chance to counsel those same clients when a cyber-hacker exfiltrated that information?  If you have not, unfortunately, it may only be a matter of time.  Cases involving the theft of export-controlled information via hacking are no longer uncommon. ', \"Recently, we've brought cases where hackers targeted cleared U.S. defense contractors and stole massive amounts of sensitive data related to military technology, including export-controlled software.  These cases are not the first of their kind, and they will almost certainly not be the last.\", 'You have the power to help your clients protect themselves.  In a modern, interconnected world, there is quickly emerging a blending of practice areas.  Trade controls blends with data privacy, and export controls and sanctions trigger questions not only of compliance but of cybersecurity. ', 'It is a fascinating time to be a practicing lawyer in this area, but one that brings with it grave responsibility. ', \"Today, we'll talk about a broad range of issues that go into being a modern export control practitioner. \", 'National Security Division', 'But first, I can explain a bit about the National Security Division of the Department of Justice. ', 'The National Security Division was created in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, in part in response to a specific recommendation from the WMD Commission.', 'The Commission identified intelligence failures that contributed to the attacks.  It highlighted the danger of the so-called wall between foreign intelligence and law enforcement.  We needed to be able to connect the dots.  We needed to change.', \"So in 2006, Congress created the National Security Division, creating the first new litigating division in the Department in almost half a century.  The National Security Division brings all of the department's resources to bear.  We bring down the wall, uniting prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the Intelligence Community.\", 'We are responsible for executing the highest priority of the Department of Justice - to protect this nation from the full range of national security threats we face.  We are proud to have this essential mission. ', \"At the top of our priority list is protecting our nation from terrorist threats.  In recent days, you've heard everyone from the president to the attorney general and the director of the FBI speaking at length about the steps we are taking to combat that threat each and every day.\", 'Just yesterday, we arrested Jalil Ibn Ameer Aziz, 19, a U.S. citizen and resident of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on charges of conspiring to provide, and attempting to provide, material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).  Aziz is alleged to have served as an intermediary between ISIL supporters.  Passing location information, including maps and a phone number, to assist persons seeking to travel and travel to and wage jihad with ISIL.', \"Although it may not seem so at first, fighting terrorism and preventing the illegal export of U.S. technology are interrelated goals.  Take the case of Feras Diri.  Diri is indicted in the very same district as Aziz.  We allege he was involved in a scheme to illegally export U.S. goods to Syria in violation of U.S. sanctions.  Some of these good were dual-use items.  It doesn't take much to imagine the consequences of those items falling into the wrong hands once it reaches Syria. \", \"One of the most significant national security threats we face, is the protection of our nation's assets - including export controlled information, as well as other sensitive information that may be targeted by nation states and terrorists.  In so doing, we take an intelligence-driven, threat-based approach.\", 'We have an entire section devoted to this work - the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, or simply CES.  We changed the name as part of a restructure to reflect the significance of export control and sanctions enforcement.  This year, CES also finalized a new Strategic Plan, setting forth an aggressive, comprehensive approach.  We know from experience that those seeking to do us harm will look for any available vulnerability to exploit.  They use all tools against us; it is our responsibility to do the same.  Our strategy is driven by the intelligence picture we see, which helps us prioritize and focus on the areas of most significant threat.', 'Our Priorities and Our Regime', 'Two of our highest priority areas involve China and WMDs.  Both are subject to export controls and regulations.', 'Our economy profits from exports, and we support the flow of goods across borders.  But we must balance economic gain with the real threat to national security posed by certain technologies falling into the wrong hands. ', 'That is why our export control regime is so important.  It is the best way to keep sensitive military and dual-use technologies, or even information that could be used in weapons of mass destruction, from ending up in the hands of terrorists and other adversaries.  They protect our innovation from being turned against us.', 'With an ever-growing and evolving set of threats targeting our sensitive technologies and information, we must be vigilant. We must look at how transactions could make us more vulnerable, and do everything in our power to mitigate those vulnerabilities.', 'Take China - despite a long-standing U.S. arms embargo, China continues to surge efforts to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.   China seeks U.S. persons with expertise to illegally provide services and know-how related to sensitive, export-controlled U.S. technology for military gain.  As an example, they targeted U.S. experts on jet engines to assist in developing Chinese-made engines.  If successful, our military edge over China is reduced; our country is put at greater risk.  Knowing what China seeks and why is essential to any sound export compliance and training program. ', 'Iranian Sanctions', 'Likewise, a high priority remains Iran.', 'Earlier this year, the United States, Iran, the E.U. and five other nations reached a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). ', 'The sanctions relief specified in the JCPOA does not go into effect until Implementation Day - which does not occur until after Iran has completed all necessary nuclear steps, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.', 'Even after Implementation Day, sanctions relief will not affect most laws and regulations enforced by the Department of Justice. ', 'With few exceptions, U.S. or foreign persons involved in the export or re-export of U.S. goods or services to Iran remain subject to prosecution under the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, as do U.S. persons involved in Iranian transactions.', 'The only sanctions relief relates to:', 'Looking beyond the sanctions to other U.S. export regulations, the JCPOA will have no effect on the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR).  Likewise, our commitment to prosecuting cases where defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List (USML), defense services and items subject to the EAR are exported to Iran remains as strong as ever.', 'So as a practical matter, what does this mean?  Bottom line, companies and individuals, whether U.S. or foreign, need to remain vigilant when it comes to any possible commercial or financial interactions with Iran.  We will continue to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute U.S. export control and sanctions cases involving Iran under our domestic authorities.  Because anything else is simply unacceptable. ', 'The export control and sanctions regime in place exists to protect this nation from the proliferation threat.  From sensitive information and technology that could pose a grave danger in the wrong hands making its way to terrorists.  From our innovation being used to develop weapons of mass destruction or ballistic missiles. ', \"Iran remains a designated state sponsor of terrorism, and we will not take our eye off of countering Iran's efforts to support international terrorism and other destabilizing activities in the region.\", 'Corporate Misconduct', 'U.S. companies - particularly in large international corporate structures, must understand this reality. ', 'The risks - not only compliance-based risks, but security risks - must be front of mind, and we hope that as the lawyers who counsel, advise and represent these companies, you will talk frankly about them.  ', \"At the Department of Justice, we continue to prioritize corporate misconduct related to export control and sanctions violations.  The deputy attorney general issued guidance and directed changes to the U.S. Attorneys' Manual to reflect the department's sharpened focus in this area including on individual corporate defendants.\", 'To provide you clarity as you advise clients, we will provide guidance to make clear our current practices on voluntary self-disclosure of export and sanctions criminal violations.  We want to be transparent about our process and the factors we consider when assessing voluntary self-disclosures.  That way, the benefits for your clients are clear, and you can provide clear counsel.', 'Because when a company voluntarily self-discloses export control and sanctions misconduct, fully cooperates and appropriately remediates, we will grant the company a significantly reduced penalty.  That can include a non-prosecution agreement (NPA), a reduced period of supervised compliance, a reduced fine and forfeiture and no requirement for a monitor. ', 'If one or more aggravating factors are present to a substantial degree - like numerous willful shipments of defense articles to a foreign terrorist organization - a more stringent resolution might be necessary.  In all cases, however, the company that voluntary discloses will find itself in a better position one that does not.', 'We are also discussing these issues with our regulatory partners to help you understand how the Department of Justice fits in to the broader regime.  The Department of Justice guidance we ultimately issue on VSDs will not supplant or supersede obligations to regulators.  Our ultimate goal is to be more transparent, so that companies will have more certainty about the benefits of self-disclosure are when dealing with prosecutors.  In the end, we think this is good for our national security mission and good for business.', 'Voluntary self-disclosure is responsible.  But even if you choose not to pursue the route of voluntary self-disclosure and cooperation, your corporate clients need to remain vigilant or they may suffer serious consequences.', 'Time and again, we have shown that willfully facilitating illegal transactions will not go unpunished. ', 'Earlier this year, Schlumberger Oilfield Holdings Ltd. (SOHL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger Ltd., one of the largest oil and gas services companies in the world, pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a penalty of over $232 million for conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by willfully facilitating illegal transactions and engaging in trade with Iran and Sudan.', \"What it ultimately came down to, was that one subsidiary failed to adequately train its employees to ensure that all U.S. persons, including non-U.S. citizens who resided in the United States, complied with Schlumberger Ltd.'s sanctions policies and compliance procedures. \", 'We will not hesitate to prosecute individuals and entities that facilitate illegal transactions in violation of U.S. sanctions.     ', 'Vigilance is essential.  Policies and procedures are simply not enough.  They must be fully executed and reinforced.  Simply \"checking the box\" by implementing an export control and sanctions compliance program without the proper support or follow through will not insulate a company from prosecution.', \"Another point to keep in mind is the need to know your markets and your people.  When you're part of a large corporate family with many segments located overseas, some subject to very different export control laws in foreign countries, you have be careful to ensure that conduct illegal in the U.S. does not become practice here.  If you have doubts, check with your regulator.  Something a foreign national employee does overseas may have been entirely legal there, but once transferred here, is a crime.\", 'When working with your clients on these and other difficult issues, implore them to be vigilant.  These are complicated areas, and it takes sound advice and a high level of scrutiny to ensure compliance.  ', 'Insider Threats', 'Unfortunately, compliance is only one piece of the puzzle.  Because, in addition to the compliance risks that are common in global operations, your corporate clients - and, in fact, even potentially their outside counsel -also are vulnerable to the threats from insiders and hackers. ', 'Insider threats - threats from trusted employees and contractors - is now a significant problem.  And they are threat to national security when they steal sensitive export-controlled technology.', \"For instance, Mozaffar Khazaee stole materials from each of three defense contractors who employed him, including materials relating to the F35 Joint Strike Fighter.  He attempted to illegally export a shipping container's worth of those proprietary, export-controlled materials to Iran in order to gain employment there.  After pleading guilty, he received 97 months in prison. \", 'Although that sentence sends a strong message to any insider who would consider violating the trust of his or her employer, deterrence alone is not enough. ', 'So what can you do to address this problem?  Report incidents of suspected insider theft as soon as they are detected.  Create detailed internal training and compliance programs designed to neutralize threats before they even occur, and provide evidence of willful or knowing conduct in the event an insider is not deterred. ', 'Cyber-Enabled Export Violations', 'That helps with threats from within our perimeters.  But unfortunately, we also face them from outside our borders.  That is why another of our export control enforcement priorities is to combat cyber exfiltration of sensitive U.S. technologies, including ITAR-controlled technical data.', 'In the digital age, foreign nations and their agents can now steal information, including export-controlled technical data and technology, without setting foot on American soil.  Left unchecked, cyber espionage can erode our strategic advantages across commercial and military spectrums.', 'When possible, we will use investigations, arrests and prosecutions, to disrupt efforts to steal from you and your clients.  We will also look to use all other legally available tools to deter, like sanctions, designations, diplomacy and other tactics. ', \"But your partnership is critical.  You can harden your defenses, create resilient systems, evaluate your cyber hygiene and cooperate with law enforcement when your defenses simply aren't enough.\", 'That is why we at the National Security Division and others throughout the U.S. government, including the FBI, have made cooperation with the private sector a key component of our export control strategy. ', 'Outreach', 'We work with U.S. companies, across all industry sectors, to ensure that our national security interests are protected.  We have spent time and energy in face-to-face sit downs so that we may better understand the concerns and challenges faced by U.S. companies, share guidance and information, and be there to help with protection, detection, attribution and response.  We can warn our companies that manufacture or sell targeted U.S. parts and technology when certain bad actors are seeking the particular parts and technology they make.', 'Corporate outreach helps sensitize industry to the threat and thereby maximizes the prevention of export control and sanctions violations.  We believe that through such efforts we can help stem the flow of those sensitive goods out of the U.S. to malicious end-users that would use them to threaten our national security interests and the safety of our warfighters. ', \"It's likely that many of you here today have clients that we've already met with recently to discuss these types of issues.  If you do not, we would certainly welcome the opportunity to do so in the future.\", 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, we recognize that our export control laws and sanctions regimes are complex and have a significant impact on the U.S. economy.  But they are there to protect against the many threats we face.', 'And you play a critical role in that effort.  You and your clients can successfully negotiate the current export control and sanctions regimes and help keep America safe.', 'Scrutinize closely each and every transaction undertaken with a foreign counterparty, whether a good or a financial transaction.', 'Make sure that you understand the relevant compliance and sanctions regimes and how they apply.', 'Make a voluntary self-disclosure to the National Security Division when you discover a willful violation of U.S. export control laws.', 'Develop robust training and compliance programs.', 'Focus not only on internal compliance, but on the threats posed by insiders and through cyberspace.', 'Harden your cyber defenses.', 'Develop a relationship with law enforcement, so that we may share valuable information with you to help you protect yourself, and be there to help you respond when your defense may simply not be enough.', 'Profits may be the lifeblood of our corporations, but cutting corners here in the interest of the bottom line, is potentially catastrophic.  You and your clients risk enforcement actions, financial penalties and prison time.  But perhaps more significantly, doing so can provide a dangerous capability to an adversary who wishes to bring about damage, destruction or death to many.  So understanding and addressing how to comply with these regimes and neutralize these threats is not only the responsible thing to do, but the only thing to do. ', \"The National Security Division will continue to approach export controls and sanctions with a broad and varied toolkit.  We will continue to vigorously pursue and prosecute those who violate our nation's export control laws, but that is not how we define success.  Success is working with you to increase education and compliance and to prevent sensitive controlled technologies from falling into the wrong hands.  We will combat threats posed by insiders and through cyberspace.  And we will coordinate with our colleagues throughout the federal government to use an all tools approach - prosecution, listing, sanctions and other means of disruption - to combat national security threats.\", 'With the careful calibration of these tools and with an eye toward mitigating vulnerabilities and defending against threats, we can protect the national security while simultaneously fostering economic growth and job creation.', 'Thank you for inviting me here this morning, and for your interest in these issues.']\n",

      "['  Jing Wang, 51, of Del Mar, Calif., a former Executive Vice President and President of Global Business Operations for Qualcomm Inc., was charged with insider trading in shares of both Qualcomm and Atheros Communications Inc. using a secret brokerage account and an offshore shell company in the British Virgin Islands.  Wang was also charged with conspiring with his brother, co-defendant Bing Wang, 53, and his former stock broker to obstruct an ongoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation and laundering the proceeds of his insider trading using a second offshore shell company and secret brokerage account.', \"  Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman of the Justice Department's Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Laura E. Duffy of the Southern District of California made the announcement.\", '  \"Insider trading is an insidious crime.  It undermines ordinary investors\\' faith in our financial markets, and the Justice Department has zero tolerance for it,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman.  \"Today\\'s charges show that you cannot trade on inside information, pocket the profit, and expect to get away with it.

A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Bing Wang, who is believed to be a citizen and resident of China.  Both men are charged in an indictment with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Jing Wang was also charged with securities fraud, money laundering and obstruction of official proceedings, which each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory two years in prison, consecutive to any other sentence.', '  The former stock broker, Gary Yin, was charged with conspiracy in a criminal information filed today in the Southern District of California and is expected to make his initial appearance on Sept. 24, 2013, at 10:00 a.m. in federal court in San Diego.', '  According to the indictment, Jing Wang used his Merrill Lynch broker, Yin, to create an offshore entity, Unicorn Global Enterprises, in the British Virgin Islands and to open a brokerage account for Unicorn at Merrill Lynch.  Jing Wang provided documents to Yin to create the false impression that his brother, Bing Wang, controlled the account, when in fact Jing Wang was the true owner of the account.  This allowed Jing Wang to conceal his true ownership and control of the assets in the account and to avoid reporting to U.S. tax authorities.  Significantly, it also allowed Jing Wang to disguise his involvement secreting tens of thousands of dollars for use in China.', \"  The indictment alleges that after the creation of the Unicorn account, Jing Wang was named an Executive Vice President of Qualcomm and fell within the company's insider trading restrictions for officers.  As an officer, Wang was exposed to Qualcomm's confidential business information, and was repeatedly notified that he was not permitted to use material, non-public information to engage in stock transactions.\", \"  Among the inside information learned by Jing Wang because of his senior position was the fact that in the first quarter of 2010, Qualcomm was poised to announce an increased quarterly dividend and a stock repurchase program.  On March 1, 2010, Jing Wang allegedly acted on this material, non-public information and directed Yin to purchase as much Qualcomm stock as possible in the Unicorn account before the information became public.  After the close of trading on March 1, 2010, Qualcomm issued a press release announcing the dividend increase and stock repurchase program, and the company's stock appreciated approximately 10 percent in value.\", \"  According to the indictment, Jing Wang next allegedly engaged in insider trading when he learned that Qualcomm was interested in purchasing Atheros.  On Dec. 1, 2010, acting on this information, Jing Wang met with Yin and instructed him to sell all Qualcomm shares in the Unicorn account.  Jing Wang then told Yin to make preparations to purchase Atheros with the funds in the account, but to wait for further confirmation.  Jing Wang's broker proceeded to liquidate all of the illegally held Qualcomm stock in the Unicorn account, resulting in ill-gotten gains of approximately $94,709 from the earlier insider trading.\", \"  On Dec. 6, 2010, while attending a meeting of Qualcomm's Board of Directors in Hong Kong, Jing Wang learned that the board had authorized Qualcomm to make a non-public offer to purchase Atheros for $45 per share.  Later that same day, Jing Wang allegedly called Yin in San Diego and instructed him to use all available funds in the secret Unicorn account to purchase Atheros stock.  The broker followed Jing Wang's instructions and purchased 10,800 shares at approximately $34 per share, for a total of $366,766.\", \"  Qualcomm's offer to purchase Atheros remained confidential until an article appeared in the Dealbook section of the New York Times' website on Jan. 4, 2011, and Qualcomm made an official announcement of the deal on Jan. 5, 2011.  Between the close of trading on Jan. 3, 2011, and the close of trading on Jan. 5, 2011, the price of Atheros stock jumped from approximately $37 to $44.50 - an increase of  approximately 20 percent.\", \"  The indictment alleges that Jing Wang engaged in a third incident of insider trading on Jan. 25, 2011, when he learned that Qualcomm was about to release record financial results.  Immediately prior to announcement of those earnings, Jing Wang directed Yin to sell all the Atheros stock in the Unicorn account and purchase Qualcomm stock.  The broker sold all of Jing Wang's illegally purchased Atheros stock for $44.60 per share, and used all of the proceeds to purchase Qualcomm stock at $50.87 per share.  The following day, after Qualcomm announced the record earnings results, Qualcomm's stock price increased by approximately $4 per share.  All told, Jing Wang illegally gained approximately a quarter of a million dollars from these three illegal transactions.\", \"  The indictment and criminal information further allege that in order to conceal his insider trading, Jing Wang conspired with Yin and his brother, Bing Wang, to conceal Jing Wang's control of the Unicorn account and his illegal purchases of Qualcomm and Atheros stock.  Yin and Bing Wang agreed to assist Jing Wang, and the three defendants engaged in a number of activities to obstruct any investigation of the trades, as well as to conceal Jing Wang's control of the Unicorn account.  These obstructive acts included concocting a false cover story that would blame Bing Wang for the illegal trades in Qualcomm and Atheros, concealing Jing Wang's actual control of the Unicorn account from Merrill Lynch, and transferring the proceeds of Jing Wang's insider trading to another offshore entity nominally owned by Jing Wang's mother.\", \"  For example, in carrying out the obstruction, the indictment alleges that in January 2012, Jing Wang forged the signature of his mother and used her identification documents to create another British Virgin Islands entity called Clearview Resources Ltd.  At Jing Wang's instruction, Yin created a Merrill Lynch account for Clearview and attempted to further distance Jing Wang from the transactions by transferring all of the money in the Unicorn account to the Clearview account in a series of structured transactions.\", '  Another example of obstructive conduct alleged in the indictment took place in March 2012, when Jing Wang met with Yin and explained that the SEC was investigating Qualcomm. At that time, Jing Wang told Yin he was worried that his control of the Unicorn account and insider trading would be discovered.  By that time, the SEC had already issued a subpoena to Jing Wang calling for him to produce information about any brokerage accounts he controlled.  Jing Wang pressed Yin to stick to the false cover story he had created earlier - that his brother, Bing Wang, had made the illegal trades.  Soon afterwards, Jing Wang gave Yin a number of Merrill Lynch documents related to his Unicorn account and directed Yin to take the documents to China, give them to Bing Wang, and help his brother use them to corroborate the false cover story.  Yin agreed, and during two trips to China in 2012, Yin met with Bing Wang, provided him with Unicorn documents removed from the United States, and rehearsed the false cover story.  The indictment further alleges that after these meetings, Bing Wang and Yin sent emails to each other containing false and misleading statements in order to make it appear that Bing Wang actually controlled the Unicorn and Clearview accounts.', \"  This case was investigated by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.  The SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office also provided assistance, and the SEC today filed a civil complaint against Jing Wang and Yin in federal court in San Diego.\", \"  This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney James McDonald of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eric J. Beste, John Parmley and Timothy Perry of the Southern District of California.\"]\n",

      "['  Thank you, Howard, for that kind introduction.  I am honored to be here with you and the other participants in this bribery and corruption conference.', '  I am asked to speak about efforts in the United States to fight foreign bribery perhaps more than on any other subject, and all over the world.  In Russia, Romania, Liberia, Sweden and other countries, I have been privileged to discuss our anti-corruption enforcement efforts, and I am delighted to do so here in London - particularly because of the close working relationship that U.S. prosecutors have with their U.K. counterparts. ', '  This is a critically important time in United States enforcement of anti-bribery laws, and other anti-fraud measures, so I am grateful for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today.', '  I want to speak with you this afternoon about what the U.S. Justice Department is doing to fight corruption around the globe, and how we do it.', \"  I have been Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division for three-and-a-half years, which I am told makes me the longest serving head of the Division in nearly 50 years.  The Justice Department's Criminal Division is based in Washington, D.C., and has approximately 600 lawyers across 15 sections.  Division lawyers prosecute an array of federal crimes - from public corruption, to cybercrime, to violent and organized crime, to financial fraud. \", '  Since 2009, my team and I have changed the division in significant ways - bringing in new, energetic leadership in virtually all of our sections, and prosecuting the highest-impact cases in the country. ', \"  One section whose work may be of particular interest to you is our Fraud Section, which has primary responsibility for criminal enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  As you may know, no criminal FCPA case can be brought in the United States without the Fraud Section's authorization.\", '  I have said before that I personally believe our FCPA work is so important.  It helps to level the playing field for U.S. and foreign companies, and motivates corporations to create genuine cultures of compliance.  Moreover, corruption has such negative effects, particular in emerging economies, that we must use every tool at our disposal to fight it.  Not only does corruption corrode the public trust and weaken democratic institutions, but it also creates gaps in government structures that organized criminal groups and terrorist networks can exploit.', '  The FCPA, which has been on the books for approximately 35 years, was the first effort of any nation to specifically criminalize the act of bribing foreign officials.  But only in the last several years has the law become a strong enforcement tool.', '  Although we of course bring our cases in the United States, our anti-corruption work has become increasingly global in scope, with ramifications for companies around the world, including here in the United Kingdom. ', \"  As just one example of the international nature of the Criminal Division's work in general - not having to do with corporations - last week, Colombian prosecutor Ramiro Anturi Larrahondo pleaded guilty to providing law enforcement information to drug traffickers as part of a cocaine trafficking conspiracy.  Anturi Larrahondo was the first Colombian prosecutor ever to be extradited to the United States.\", '  As I mentioned, I have traveled to many countries as head of the Criminal Division, and perceptions about corruption - and of our prosecutorial efforts - differ widely.', '  I was in Russia earlier this year, for example, where the issue of corruption is front and center.  Last year, Russia passed a law criminalizing foreign bribery and joined the OECD Working Group on Bribery.', '  These developments notwithstanding, Russia is still a place where corruption is perceived to be a very significant problem.  Transparency International ranked Russia 143rd on its most recent Corruption Perceptions Index.  Yet, based on my discussions there, it is clear to me that companies that take a hard line against corruption, and develop strong cultures of compliance, can thrive in Russia, as they do elsewhere.', '  My sense is that in the United Kingdom, over the past two years, attitudes toward foreign bribery have changed in light of the U.K. Bribery Act.   But, as it did in the United States, I expect it will take time for the full impact of the law to sink in.', '  Criminal enforcement is a critically important aspect of our anti-corruption work.  But, in the Criminal Division, we have also been developing an asset forfeiture initiative - the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative - that involves civil actions against the proceeds of foreign official corruption.', \"  Attorney General Holder announced the initiative in Uganda in 2010, and my team and I have been building the initiative in the Criminal Division's Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section since then.  Our theory is simple: Even if we cannot pursue you criminally in the United States - because we lack criminal jurisdiction, for example - corrupt leaders should not be permitted to use the United States as a safe haven for the proceeds of their corrupt activities. \", '  We have recently had our first Kleptocracy Initiative successes.  In July, for example, we announced that we had secured a restraining order against more than $3 million in corruption proceeds related to James Onanefe Ibori, the former governor of the oil-producing Delta State in Nigeria; and, earlier this month, we executed restraints against an additional $4 million in Ibori assets, including the proceeds from the sale of a penthouse unit in the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, D.C.  Ibori was previously convicted here in the United Kingdom on money laundering and fraud charges and sentenced to 13 years in prison.', \"  Another example involves two civil forfeiture complaints we have filed against approximately $70 million in assets allegedly belonging to Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, a government minister for Equatorial Guinea and the son of that country's president.  According to the complaints, despite an official government salary of less than $100,000 per year, Minister Obiang corruptly amassed wealth of more than $100 million.  Among the items that we are seeking to forfeit are a Gulfstream jet, a mansion in Malibu, Calif., and $1.8 million worth of Michael Jackson memorabilia.\", '  There is plenty of corporate misconduct to keep prosecutors in the United States busy - both FCPA-related and non-FCPA-related.', '  We have ongoing investigations of several large financial institutions, and we have resolved cases against many others.  Earlier in my tenure, for example, we resolved a case against Credit Suisse, which agreed to forfeit $536 million in connection with violations relating to transactions the bank conducted on behalf of customers from Iran, Sudan and other sanctioned countries.', '  As a result both of increased FCPA enforcement and increased policing of corporate conduct in general, I think that the culture of corporate compliance has improved in recent years.  As I explained in a speech in New York City recently, until roughly 20 years ago, prosecutors in the United States, when they encountered corporate misconduct, were usually faced with a stark choice - either to indict, or walk away.', \"  That began to change in the 1990s, when the government started doing something new:  agreeing to defer prosecution against the corporation in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing; cooperation with the government's investigation, including against individual employees; payment of monetary penalties; and concrete steps to improve the company's behavior.  And, over the past decade, deferred prosecution agreements, or DPAs, have become an important part of corporate criminal law enforcement.\", '  I am aware that the U.K. government recently put forth a proposal to introduce DPAs as a way of resolving corporate cases in the U.K.  Based on the United States experience, my sense is that the availability of DPAs here would represent a positive step forward.', '  In the United States, the increased use of DPAs has meant far greater accountability for corporate wrongdoing.  Whereas prosecutors often declined when their only choice was to indict or walk away, now companies know that avoiding the disaster scenario of an indictment does not mean an escape from accountability. ', \"  This past June, for example, the Fraud Section resolved allegations of criminal wrongdoing against Barclays Bank over the bank's role in the manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR.  Barclays, which entered into a non-prosecution agreement, or NPA, with the government, paid a significant price for its egregious conduct.  In the wake of our announcement, the top management of the bank was replaced.  But, as we also recognized at the time, Barclays's cooperation with our investigation was extraordinary, which is why an NPA was appropriate in that case. \", '  DPAs and NPAs are appropriate in certain circumstances and, therefore, they can be useful alternatives to criminal indictments.  But they cannot be a substitute for criminal charges.  Just last week, for example, we announced criminal trade secret theft charges against Kolon Industries, a South Korean corporation, and five Kolon executives and employees.  As the Kolon case shows, we do not hesitate to charge corporations criminally in appropriate circumstances, in addition to holding individuals accountable.', '  As I have said repeatedly, the strongest deterrent against corporate wrongdoing is the prospect of prison time.  That is why I have put such a high priority on making sure that individuals are prosecuted when the evidence warrants prosecution.  To give you just two Criminal Division examples:  Lee Bentley Farkas, the former chairman of Taylor Bean & Whitaker, which was one of the largest private mortgage lending companies in the country, is serving a 30-year prison sentence for having masterminded a nearly $3 billion bank and securities fraud, and several of his co-conspirators are also serving substantial prison sentences.  R. Allen Stanford, who misappropriated $7 billion from Stanford International Bank to finance his personal businesses, is serving a 110-year sentence.  ', \"  A third example involves the prosecution of Garth Peterson.  A former managing director of Morgan Stanley, Peterson pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade the bank's internal FCPA controls and was sentenced to prison in August.  Because Morgan Stanley voluntarily disclosed Peterson's misconduct, fully cooperated with our investigation and showed us that it maintained a rigorous compliance program, including extensive training of bank employees on the FCPA and other anti-corruption measures, we declined to bring any enforcement action against the institution in connection with Peterson's conduct. \", '  Prosecutors need to be smart about how they use their discretion in the FCPA context, as in every context.  And, as we did in the Peterson case, we always attempt to strike an appropriate balance between vigorous and responsible enforcement.', '  In recent years, we have witnessed a significant awakening to the problem of corruption around the globe.  Russia, China and India are taking foreign bribery more seriously than ever before; the U.K. has an important new Bribery Act; and, perhaps due in part to United States enforcement efforts, companies and individuals doing business around the world are coming to appreciate that they will be held accountable for the way they conduct business with foreign officials.  In short, the world is moving in one direction only with respect to anti-corruption efforts.  There is still plenty of work to be done.  But we are making progress, and I hope and believe that we will continue to make strides in this area together.', '  Thank you.']\n"

      "[\"  SAN FRANCISCO - A federal grand jury in San Francisco has charged five individuals and five companies with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets for their roles in a long-running effort to obtain U.S. trade secrets for the benefit of companies controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), announced U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag; Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice; and Stephanie Douglas, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI San Francisco Division.\", '  According to the superseding indictment, the government of the PRC identified as a priority the development of chloride-route titanium dioxide (TiO2) production capabilities.  TiO2 is a commercially valuable white pigment with numerous uses, including coloring paint, plastics and paper.  To achieve that goal, companies controlled by the PRC government, specifically the Pangang Group companies named in the superseding indictment, and employees of those companies conspired and attempted to illegally obtain TiO2 technology that had been developed over many years of research and development by E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont).', '  According to the superseding indictment, the Pangang Group companies were aided in their efforts by individuals in the United States who had obtained TiO2 trade secrets and were willing to sell those secrets for significant sums of money.  Defendants Walter Liew, Christina Liew, Robert Maegerle and Tze Chao obtained and possessed TiO2 trade secrets belonging to DuPont.  Each of these individuals allegedly sold information containing DuPont TiO2 trade secrets to the Pangang Group companies for the purpose of helping those companies develop large-scale chloride route TiO2 production capability in the PRC, including a planned 100,000 ton TiO2 factory at Chongqing, PRC.', '  According to the superseding indictment, the Liews, USA Performance Technology Inc. (USAPTI), and one of its predecessor companies, Performance Group, entered into contracts worth in excess of $20 million to convey TiO2 trade secret technology to Pangang Group companies.  The Liews allegedly received millions of dollars of proceeds from these contracts.  The proceeds were wired through the United States, Singapore and ultimately back into several bank accounts in the PRC in the names of relatives of Christina Liew. ', '  The five individuals charged in the indictment are:', '  The superseding indictment also names five companies as defendants:', '  Each of the five corporate defendants named in the superseding indictment are charged with conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and attempted economic espionage.  Summonses were issued to each corporate defendant requiring them to appear in court in San Francisco on March 1, 2012, at 9:30 a.m. for arraignment on the superseding indictment.', '  DuPont is a company based in Wilmington, Del., that manufactures a wide variety of products, including TiO2.  DuPont invented the chloride-route process for manufacturing TiO2 in the late-1940s and since then has invested heavily in research and development to improve that production process.  The global titanium dioxide market has been valued at roughly $12 billion, and DuPont has the largest share of that market.', \"  The chloride-route process is more efficient and cleaner than the sulfate-route process prevalent in the PRC.  The superseding indictment alleges that the object of the defendants' conspiracy was to convey DuPont's secret chloride-route technology to the PRC companies for the purpose of building modern TiO2 production facilities in the PRC without investing in time-consuming and expensive research and development.\", '  DuPont reported information to the FBI that its TiO2 trade secrets had been misappropriated.  The FBI opened an investigation in March 2011.', '  \"As today\\'s case demonstrates, technology developed by U.S. companies is vulnerable to concerted efforts by competitors - both at home and abroad - to steal that technology,\" said U.S. Attorney Haag.  \"Fighting economic espionage and trade secret theft is one of the top priorities of this Office and we will aggressively pursue anyone, anywhere who attempts to steal valuable information from the United States.\"', '  Assistant Attorney General Monaco said, \"The theft of America\\'s trade secrets for the benefit of China and other nations poses a substantial and continuing threat to our economic and national security, and we are committed to holding accountable anyone who robs American businesses of their hard-earned research.  I thank the agents and prosecutors who helped bring about this important case.\" ', '  FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Stephanie Douglas stated, \"The conduct alleged in the superseding indictment reveals a methodical effort by foreign interests to misappropriate valuable U.S. technology by using individuals operating within our borders.  The goal of this scheme was to obtain the benefit of research and development investments by U.S. companies, without making the same investment of time and money.  This is not only unfair, but it does great damage to the U.S. economy and as a result undercuts on national security.  The FBI is committed to rooting out commercial espionage that puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage in the global market.\"', '  The maximum statutory penalty for each of the charges alleged in the superseding indictment is as follows:', \"  The case is being prosecuted by the Special Prosecutions and National Security Unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, and the Counterespionage Section of the U.S. Department of Justice.

      "[\"  WASHINGTON - Noshir S. Gowadia, 66, of Maui, Hawaii, was sentenced late yesterday to 32 years in prison for communicating classified national defense information to the People's Republic of China (PRC), illegally exporting military technical data, as well as money laundering, filing false tax returns and other offenses.\", '   ', '  The sentence, handed down by Chief U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway in the District of Hawaii, was announced by David Kris, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and Florence T. Nakakuni, U.S. Attorney for the District of Hawaii.', '   ', '  On Aug. 9, 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu, a federal jury found Gowadia guilty of five criminal offenses relating to his design for the PRC of a low-signature cruise missile exhaust system capable of rendering a PRC cruise missile resistant to detection by infrared missiles.   ', '   ', \"  The jury also convicted Gowadia in three counts of illegally communicating classified information regarding lock-on range for infrared missiles against the U.S. B-2 bomber to persons not authorized to receive such information.   The B-2 bomber is one of America's most critical defense assets, capable of utilizing its stealth characteristics to penetrate enemy airspace and deliver precision guided weapons on multiple targets.   Gowadia was also convicted of unlawfully exporting classified information about the\", '    B-2, illegally retaining information related to U.S. national defense at his home, money laundering and filing false tax returns for the years 2001 and 2002.   ', '   ', '  \"Mr. Gowadia provided some of our country\\'s most sensitive weapons-related designs to the Chinese government for money.   He is now being held accountable for his actions.   This prosecution should serve as a warning to others who would compromise our nation\\'s military secrets for profit. I commend the prosecutors, analysts and agents - including those from the FBI and the Air Force - who were responsible for this investigation and prosecution,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kris.', '   ', '  \"Justice is finally done in this lengthy and complex case where highly classified information and sensitive technology was unlawfully disclosed and transferred to the People\\'s Republic of China, and other persons and entities as well.   Mr. Gowadia went beyond disclosing information to China, he performed defense work in that nation with the purpose of assisting them in their stealth weapons design programs.   While the full damage of his activities may never be known, we are comforted that justice has been done, and that Mr. Gowadia will spend 32 years in federal prison, incapable of betraying the United States of America again.   It must be remembered also that Mr. Gowadia\\'s sentence also addresses his creation of an international identity to hide his income and launder his ill gotten gains.   I deeply appreciate the hard work of the FBI, the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division in assisting us in obtaining the espionage, arms export, tax and money laundering convictions in this important case,\" said U.S. Attorney Nakakuni.', '   ', '  \"Along with our partners in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, the FBI will continue to pursue anyone who attempts to sell America\\'s national security secrets for personal gain.

Not only did he sell out his country for personal gain, but he also cheated us all out of the tax owed on those ill-gotten gains.   In short, his actions were despicable from beginning to end,\" said Marcus Williams, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Special Agent in Charge of Hawaii.', '   ', '  Gowadia was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint alleging that he willfully communicated national defense information to a person not entitled to receive it.

Gowadia also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the U.S. government until 1997, when his security clearance was terminated.

At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the PRC.   The jury convicted Gowadia of two specific transmissions of classified information: a PowerPoint presentation on the exhaust nozzle of a PRC cruise missile project and an evaluation of the effectiveness of a redesigned nozzle, and a computer file providing his signature prediction of a PRC cruise missile outfitted with his modified exhaust nozzle and associated predictions in relation to a U.S. air-to-air missile.', '   ', \"  The prosecution also produced evidence that documented Gowadia's use of three foreign entities he established and controlled, including a Liechtenstein charity purportedly for the benefit of children, to hide, launder and disguise the income he received from foreign countries.   Gowadia admitted on cross examination at trial that he never donated money to any charity using the foundation, despite repeatedly representing that he did to the IRS and others.   In addition to demonstrating that Gowadia under-reported his income and falsely denied having control over foreign bank accounts for the two tax years involved in his convictions, the evidence at trial revealed that Gowadia had not paid any income tax since from at least 1997 until 2005 when he was arrested.

I appreciate your warm welcome, and I am grateful for the support - and the inspiring example - that you and your colleagues in the An Garda Siochana are providing to the international law enforcement community.\", 'I would also like to thank INTERPOL, Hong Kong Customs, and Underwriters Laboratories for hosting this important conference - and for bringing together so many leaders, experts, and partners from law enforcement agencies across the world.', \"During my service as the Attorney General of the United States, I have had the privilege of working with many of you on a broad range of issues. I have seen, firsthand, the power of our joint efforts. And I am convinced that the work of our nations' law enforcement agencies - to combat terrorism, to dismantle drug cartels and human trafficking rings, to stop child pornographers and others who would prey on our most vulnerable citizens - is more effective because of our collaboration. To address new and emerging threats - and to protect the security, and defend the liberties, of the people we serve - this cooperation must continue.\", \"It is fitting that we are gathered here in Hong Kong - a center of global innovation - to chart our course forward. Not only is Hong Kong one of the world's most vibrant and modern cities, it is headquarters for so many leading international organizations and corporations. It is a hub for international politics, law, education, and commerce. And, this week, I hope it is the meeting ground for unprecedented international cooperation.\", 'This conference is an important opportunity - a chance to focus the attention, and to harness the talents and resources, of the international law enforcement community in protecting intellectual property rights, safeguarding innovation, ensuring the health and safety of our citizens, and combating the international networks of organized criminals now seeking to profit from IP crimes.', 'Together, we are signaling that a new era of cooperation, engagement, and vigilance has begun. And we are sending an unequivocal message to criminals profiting from the ingenuity of others or endangering the safety of our citizens by selling defective or dangerous counterfeit goods. We will find you. We will stop you. And you will be punished.', \"Protecting intellectual property is a top priority for the United States - for President Obama, for me, and for America's law enforcement community. Today, I am eager to share some of ways we are working to accomplish this goal and to overcome the challenges we all face.\", \"In the United States, and here in Asia, intellectual property accounts for a significant and growing segment of commercial trade. But the same technologies that have spurred rapid growth in the legitimate economy have also allowed criminals to misappropriate the creativity of our innovators and entrepreneurs - and to operate global enterprises that survive by executing IP schemes. In fact, for every technological and commercial quantum leap we have made, criminals - and often entire international criminal syndicates - have kept pace. They have developed sophisticated methods for committing every imaginable type of intellectual property offense. They aren't just selling counterfeit clothing or electronics. They're selling defective and dangerous imitations of critical components, like brake pads, or everyday consumer goods, like toothpaste. They're conducting corporate espionage. They're pirating music, movies, games, software, and other copyrighted works - both on our cities' streets and online. And the consequences are devastating. The global software industry is a prime example. According to recent industry reports, it is now estimated that, worldwide, more than 40 percent of all software installed on personal computers is obtained illegally - with forgone revenues to the software industry topping $50 billion. These are funds that could have been invested in new jobs and next-generation technologies. And software piracy affects more than just the software industry - since, for every $1 of PC software sold, it's estimated that more than $3 of revenues are lost to local IT support and distribution services. Other IP and support industries are seeing the same ripple effect of losses - and current trends are alarming. Perhaps most concerning of all, however, is the widespread growth we've seen in the international sale of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, which can put the stability of corporations - and, more importantly, the health of consumers - at serious risk.\", 'For too long, these illegal activities have been perceived as \"business as usual.\" But not anymore. As each of you knows, stealing innovative ideas or passing off counterfeits can have devastating consequences for individuals, families, and communities. These crimes threaten economic opportunities and financial stability. They suppress the ingenuity of our people and businesses. They destroy jobs. And they can jeopardize the health and safety of the men and women we are sworn to protect. Intellectual property crimes are not victimless. And we must make certain that they are no longer perceived as risk-free.', 'As global criminal networks increasingly fund their illicit activities through intellectual property crimes, our challenge is not simply to keep up. Our strategies must become more sophisticated than those employed by the criminals we pursue. Our collaboration across borders must become more seamless. And our determination must not waver.', 'But the simple truth is that our chain of necessary and desired enforcement is only as strong as its weakest link. Let me be blunt: Not every country, not every organization has done enough. It is time to be clear, and honest, about where we can - and where we must - improve. If we are going to turn the page on the problem of international intellectual property crime, we must fully assess current efforts and commit to making meaningful, measurable enhancements.', \"Like many of your own governments, the Obama Administration recognizes that our nation's economic prosperity is increasingly tied to industries - like software or life sciences - that rely on strong IP enforcement. That is why we have created a new framework, and called for an increased level of activity, to better protect intellectual property rights.\", \"As many of you know, last year, President Obama created a new leadership role in the White House - Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator - and appointed Victoria Espinel to fill this position. I am pleased that Victoria is here with us today. As IP Enforcement Coordinator, her first order of business was to develop a comprehensive strategic plan to guide our government's efforts to protect intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The strategic plan was released by the White House this summer. Already, it is strengthening and streamlining our efforts to detect and prosecute IP crimes. This work is just one example of the administration's renewed focus on IP protection.\", \"Last December, Vice President Biden convened the administration's first intellectual property summit, which brought together cabinet officials and industry leaders to discuss intellectual property rights and policies - and to identify ways to improve our enforcement efforts. During that summit, I had the chance to discuss the Justice Department's intellectual property enforcement strategy and the critical work being done by some of our most talented lawyers and investigators.\", 'A key part of this strategy is led by Justice Department prosecutors - many of whom are focused exclusively on computer and intellectual property crimes. I am committed to making sure that these prosecutors have the resources and the specialized training necessary to prevent, identify, and stop IP violations - and to spot emerging crime trends more quickly.', \"Of course, the outstanding work of our prosecutors isn't done, and couldn't be accomplished, in isolation. It is supported by the skills and dedication of the investigative agents who develop the cases we bring in court. At every level of the Justice Department, we are committed to improving partnerships with our federal law enforcement colleagues - and with leaders across the international law enforcement community. In particular, I would like to note the great work being done through the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, which is led by our colleagues in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The IPR Center brings together investigators and analysts from a number of federal agencies to coordinate our efforts to investigate counterfeiting, online piracy, and other IP violations.\", \"To build on the contributions and achievements of our prosecutors and investigators, in February of this year, I reestablished the Justice Department's Task Force on Intellectual Property. Chaired by the Deputy Attorney General, the Task Force includes senior leaders from across the Department. And, as many of you know, it's focused on facilitating coordination among international law enforcement partners. A cornerstone of this effort is the Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator program.\", 'With the help of our colleagues in the Department of State, the Justice Department has deployed two federal prosecutors - based in Bangkok, Thailand, and in Sofia, Bulgaria - to manage our IP protection efforts in Southeast Asia and in Eastern Europe. They work closely with our international counterparts to share information and evidence regarding joint investigations and to enhance IP enforcement training programs. Here in Asia, one of our law enforcement coordinators is actively engaged in efforts to strengthen the work of the IP Criminal Enforcement Network.', \"But this work is not just for our coordinators alone. Following this conference, I will travel to Beijing, where I look forward to meeting with my counterparts and other officials to discuss how we can build on our nations' bilateral enforcement efforts through the Intellectual Property Working Group of the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group for Law Enforcement Cooperation. Together, I hope we can work to identify the most pressing, and perilous, gaps in our enforcement mechanisms - and begin taking the steps required to close these gaps, strengthen IP protections, and fulfill the most critical obligations of public service: ensuring opportunity, fostering prosperity, and protecting the safety and health of our people.\", 'In this work, I pledge my own best efforts. And, today, I ask for yours. I will continue to seek out and seize opportunities to foster stronger relationships, and greater cooperation, among international law enforcement agencies. But I also know that, without your help - and until every nation makes a commitment, and takes action, to ensure aggressive IP enforcement - we will not solve the challenges that now bring us together.', \"Strong partnerships provide our best chance for success. In fact, we've seen, clearly, how international collaboration can lead to effective prosecutions. As Attorney General, I am particularly proud of the work we're doing in the United States to fight intellectual property crime in the courtroom. But I also that recognize that our outstanding record of criminal prosecutions could not have been achieved without the help of our partners around the world.\", 'Recently, the Justice Department has made significant and encouraging progress in prosecuting individuals, and international criminal organizations, that traffic in counterfeit pharmaceuticals. For example, just two months ago, we successfully prosecuted a defendant who was selling fake cancer medications to patients in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The drugs - which he marketed as a rare, experimental treatment - were manufactured in Canada, but advertised and sold globally over the Internet. With assistance from Canadian and German authorities, this individual was apprehended and extradited to the United States, where he was finally brought to justice.', 'And earlier this year, in Richmond, Virginia, the Justice Department won convictions in one of the largest intellectual property cases in U.S. history, involving more than $100 million in counterfeit luxury goods. The defendants were part of an international group of criminals that owned and operated 13 companies and 8 manufacturing plants. During the investigation, Hong Kong authorities provided critical help in obtaining evidence for trial, and we remain extremely grateful for that assistance.', 'These are just two of many examples, but each illustrates the vital importance of international cooperation in the fight against IP crime. Without the help of our international partners, we could not have brought these crimes to light - or brought the criminals involved to justice.', \"The Justice Department is also exploring ways to strengthen its IP enforcement efforts by incorporating the legal tools we use routinely to combat money laundering, fraud, and other types of economic crime. And we have included intellectual property crime as a focus area of the Justice Department's International Organized Crime Strategy.\", 'Although the progress we have made in the United States, and around the world, is encouraging - we cannot yet be satisfied. And we must not become complacent.', 'Each of us - and every member of the international law enforcement community - has pledged to protect the rights and security of the citizens we serve. But none of us can fulfill that promise alone. In this age of instantaneous global communication, when criminal activity knows no bounds, our enforcement work must extend beyond our own borders. Working together is no longer just the best way forward. Now, it is the only way forward.', \"On behalf of the United States, I am grateful for your partnership, your leadership, and your cooperation in protecting the safety of our citizens, the strength of our markets, and the intellectual property rights of our nations' innovators and entrepreneurs.\", 'This is critical, and urgent, work. And we must never let our differences, and occasional disagreements, blind us to the central truth that the security, basic freedoms, and best interests of our citizens are, and will continue to be, intimately connected.', 'Our task is great - but our success is possible. Only if we work in common cause, only if we put the full measure of national commitment in our efforts, and only if we honor the values we share, can we - and will we - create a world in which intellectual property crime is not the domain of the future, but a marker of the past.', 'Thank you.']\n",

The jury also convicted Gowadia of illegally communicating classified information on three other occasions and unlawfully exporting technical information on those three occasions, illegally retaining defense information, and filing false tax returns for the years 2001 and 2002.  The jury acquitted Gowadia of three other offenses alleging illegal communication of information to the PRC.\", '       ', '      The verdict was announced by David Kris, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and Florence T.

The jury convicted Gowadia of two specific transmissions of classified information: a PowerPoint presentation concerning the exhaust nozzle of a PRC cruise missile project and an evaluation of the effectiveness of a redesigned nozzle, and a computer file providing his signature prediction of a PRC cruise missile outfitted with his modified exhaust nozzle and associated predictions in relation to a U.S. air-to-air missile.', '       ', \"      The prosecution also produced evidence which documented Gowadia's use of three foreign entities he controlled, including a Liechtenstein charity purportedly for the benefit of children, to disguise the income he received from foreign countries.  In addition to demonstrating that Gowadia under-reported his income and falsely denied having control over foreign bank accounts for the two tax years involved in his convictions, the evidence at trial revealed that Gowadia had not paid any income tax since from at least 1997 until 2005 when he was arrested.\", '       ', '      Chief U.S. States District Judge Susan Oki Mollway set sentencing for Nov. 22, 2010.

      "[\"  A former Rockwell and Boeing engineer from Orange County, Calif., was remanded into custody this morning after a federal judge convicted him of charges of economic espionage and acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China, for whom he stole restricted technology and Boeing trade secrets, including information related to the Space Shuttle program and Delta IV rocket.\", '  Dongfan \"Greg\" Chung, 73, who was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until its defense and space unit was acquired by Boeing in 1996, was found guilty by U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney, who presided over a three-week bench trial last month.', \"  In his ruling read this morning in court, Judge Carney found Chung guilty of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country, one count of acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China and one count of making false statements to the FBI.\", '  Immediately following the reading of the verdicts, Judge Carney remanded Chung into custody, where he will remain until his sentencing, which was scheduled for Nov. 9, 2009. Chung had been freed after being arrested by special agents with the FBI and investigators with NASA in February 2008.', '  Chung, a native of China who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, held a \"secret\" security clearance when he worked at Rockwell and Boeing on the Space Shuttle program. He retired from the company in 2002, but the next year he returned to Boeing as a contractor, a position he held until September 2006. At trial last month, the government proved that Chung took and concealed Boeing trade secrets relating to the Space Shuttle and the Delta IV rocket, materials he acquired for the benefit of the PRC.', '  David Kris, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said: \"For years, Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing relating to the Space Shuttle and the Delta IV rocket - all for the benefit of the government of China. Today\\'s verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America\\'s economic and national security to assist foreign governments. The many agents, analysts and prosecutors who worked on this important case deserve special thanks for their efforts.\"', '  \"Mr. Chung stole restricted technology for the benefit of a foreign nation, and as a result he has lost the freedom he was offered by this nation,\" said U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O\\'Brien. \"The stolen technology compromised not only the American company that developed and owned the trade secrets, but national security as well because the secrets could be used by the PRC to develop its own military technology.\"', '  Salvador Hernandez, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI in Los Angeles, stated: \"The cost of Mr. Chung\\'s traitorous actions to American security and the economy cannot be quantified, but have now been exposed, and his ability to exploit critical technology has come to an end.

I\\'m confident this milestone conviction will serve as a deterrent to would-be spies contemplating theft of precious U.S. secrets.\"', '  The case against Chung resulted from an investigation into another engineer who worked in the United States and obtained sensitive military information for the PRC. That engineer, Chi Mak, and several of his family members were convicted of providing defense articles to the PRC. Chi Mak was sentenced last year to more than 24 years in federal prison (see:     http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2008/032.html).', '  According to the evidence presented during the trial, individuals in the Chinese aviation industry began sending Chung \"tasking\" letters as early as 1979. Over the years, the letters directed Chung to collect specific technological information, including data related to the Space Shuttle and various military and civilian aircraft. Chung allegedly responded in one undated letter that \"I would like to make an effort to contribute to the Four Modernizations of China.\" In various letters to his handlers in the PRC, Chung referenced engineering manuals he had collected and sent to the PRC, including 24 manuals relating to the B-1 Bomber that Rockwell had prohibited from disclosure outside of the company and \"selected federal agencies.\"', '  Between 1985 and 2003, Chung made multiple trips to the PRC to deliver lectures on technology involving the Space Shuttle and other programs, and during those trips he met with PRC government officials, to include agents affiliated with the People\\'s Liberation Army. Chung and PRC officials exchanged letters that discussed Chung\\'s travel to China and recommended methods for passing information, including suggestions that Chung use Chi Mak and his wife Rebecca to transmit information.

      "[\"From Edison to 'New Madison': Division Activity at the Intersection of Innovation, Competition Law and Technology \", \"Good morning.  It is a pleasure to speak with you today, thanks for the invitation.  I will start with prepared remarks highlighting some of the Antitrust Division's work over the last year and then, time permitting, would be happy to take questions or discuss any issues. \", \"As most of you likely know, antitrust law is focused heavily on efficiency and consumer welfare--and, in particular, static and dynamic efficiency in the economy.  The Division's enforcement philosophy acknowledges the importance of innovation as a vital ingredient to promote those efficiencies and to enhance competition and consumer welfare, particularly through the introduction and refinement of technology.  Therefore, my remarks today will focus most heavily on the Division's recent enforcement and advocacy activity to protect innovation in the technology sector. \", 'I\\'ll begin with a quote from Thomas Edison, who said \"I find out what the world needs.  Then I go ahead and try to invent it.\"[1]  There are over 1,000 patents in Edison\\'s name, which he developed in the first R&D laboratory of its kind in Menlo Park, NJ.  In his lab, among other innovations, Edison improved upon attempts to create an electric light bulb that consumers could use at home.  Edison not only created an electric light that was safe and economical, but he also built the lighting system that formed the basis for the U.S. electric industry.[2]  Edison developed similar ground-breaking inventions with the phonograph and system for motion pictures.[3]  To be sure, Edison found ways to make innovation better and improve upon the ideas that came before. ', 'Similar innovation happens in standards development when industries collaborate to harness the best technical solutions that bring safer and more efficient products and services to consumers.  Across technology areas, innovators today develop a vision of what the world needs, and like Edison, set out to invent it.  Often, they work together to bring consumers new complementary products and services that interoperate.  We see these sorts of collaborative developments happening now in the setting of standards for 5G technologies that promise connected products and services like autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and smart city applications.[4]  For standards to be successful, it is critical that the process for their development be industry-led, competitive, and balanced. ', 'With this in mind, let me start with a brief discussion of our recent enforcement activity in the tech sector and then I will turn to our advocacy and business review work, as well as other developments we are keeping an eye on, with respect to patents, competition, and standard-setting.', 'The Division has been hard at work tackling competitive issues in technology and digital markets to ensure innovation continues to flourish.  Today, these markets cover a vast and ever-expanding array of underlying goods and services.  Our recent enforcement efforts make this clear.  Earlier this year, for instance, the Division required significant divestitures to resolve competitive harms in markets related to intelligence and communications technologies in the military, government, and commercial spaces.  Our investigation of the merger between United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon Company revealed that these were the only firms developing, manufacturing, and selling military airborne radios--devices that allow secure voice, data, and video communications to and from aircraft, and which are installed on every airplane and helicopter the Department of Defense (DOD) currently uses.  The investigation further revealed that UTC and Raytheon were a couple of the only competitors for military GPS systems for aviation, maritime, and ground applications; and that they were a couple of just a few firms capable of producing several components for space-based optical/infrared (EO/IR) reconnaissance satellites.  These satellites provide the DOD and U.S. intelligence community customers with essential information like early warning missile launches.  Our divestitures sought to remedy any potential harms to competition and innovation in these critical overlapping technology businesses.', \"Similarly, the Division obtained a key divestiture to maintain competition for large geostationary satellite antennas in a transaction between General Dynamics and Communications and Power Industries LLC (CPI), a portfolio company of Odyssey Investment Partners Fund V, LP (Odyssey).  These antennas are essential components of government, military, and commercial satellite communication networks.  CPI and General Dynamics' subsidiary GD SATCOM were two of only a few firms designing, manufacturing, and selling these antennas.  The divestitures the Division obtained in these cases preserve competition that leads to lower costs and increased innovation in critical military and defense products, benefiting Americans as citizens and as taxpayers.\", \"Turning now from the military, government, and intelligence space to commercial telecommunications--just last week the Division announced that it would require key divestitures to resolve competitive issues arising from Liberty Latin America Ltd.'s (Liberty) acquisition of AT&T Inc.'s wireline and wireless telecom operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Our investigation revealed that the transaction as originally contemplated would have eliminated competition for essential fiber-optic-based telecommunications services.  Businesses in Puerto Rico rely on these fiber-optic services for everyday operations.  By requiring the parties to divest Liberty's subsidiary, Liberty Communications of Puerto Rico, and certain AT&T fiber-based telecom assets and customer accounts in Puerto Rico, the settlement will preserve vigorous competition that benefits businesses across Puerto Rico.\", \"And of course, the Division has also been very busy in digital markets.  As Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim announced last summer, we are undertaking a large-scale review of the diverse business practices of the world's largest digital markets companies, including various online platforms.  Our review covers potentially anticompetitive business practices spanning many years, and examines numerous permutations of business models and competitive landscapes. We have been hiring digital markets fellows throughout the year and have a very large team dedicated to this project.  This work is distinct from the Department's work on the qualified immunity for certain digital platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\", \"Last week, in what is the first public matter to come out of the digital markets review, we filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of D.C. to stop Google from unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the search and search advertising markets.  The Complaint alleges that Google has entered into a series of exclusionary agreements that work together to lock up the primary ways in which customers access search engines--and, through search engines, the internet. As the Complaint explains, Google generally has used its monopoly profits to buy preferential or exclusive treatment for its search engine on numerous devices, browsers, and other search access points, creating a continuous and self-reinforcing cycle of monopolization.  These practices have harmed competition and consumers, hampered innovation, and prevented competitors from disciplining Google's anticompetitive conduct.  As we take this matter to court, I am confident our efforts will lead to a more competitive search and search advertising ecosystem, protect innovation, and benefit consumers.\", 'Now I would like to address the Antitrust Division\\'s work in the area of intellectual property and standards development, which has been a key focus for the Division under AAG Delrahim.  Under his \"New Madison\" approach, the Division has cautioned against the misapplication of antitrust theories to licensing disputes that involve a patent holder unilaterally exercising its exclusive rights conferred by the U.S. Constitution.[5]  James Madison was a fierce advocate of strong patent protection, including exclusive rights for inventors, because he recognized it drives innovation.  In The Federalist Papers, Madison argued that the \"[t]he copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of common law,\" and that \"[t]he right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors.\"[6]  His rationale was that \"[t]he public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of individuals.\"[7]  Madison\\'s advocacy resulted in the Patent and Copyright Clause in the U.S. Constitution.[8]  The Division shares Madison\\'s view that patent and copyright protection can drive individuals and firms large and small to continue to innovate and, therefore, it has sought a reasoned approach to antitrust enforcement when it comes to intellectual property.', 'Some commentators and parties, however, have advocated for the use of antitrust law as a mechanism to enforce commitments made by patent holders to license standards implementers on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.  Their fear is that a patent holder can \"hold-up\" implementers at an above-FRAND rate and that antitrust liability can be used to prevent an injunction and reach a reasonable royalty.  The Division has repeatedly cautioned against the misapplication of antitrust law to mere royalty disputes, where there has been no harm to the competitive process.  Such harms are better remedied by contract and patent laws; antitrust is an ill (and potentially harmful) fit.  Although competition may result in lower prices, U.S. antitrust law does not regulate royalties even if they are supra-FRAND.[9]  Nor does it force individual firms to deal, except in rare circumstances.  Moreover, the reliance on antitrust law as a FRAND bargaining tool increases the likelihood of \"hold-out,\" where implementers may delay taking a license.  This stalls payment for the use of a standard essential patent, which can have detrimental effects on innovation.[10]  Standard essential patent holders must have some recourse free of antitrust liability.  Consequently, the Department has recognized that \"[i]njunctive relief is a critical enforcement mechanism and bargaining tool--subject to traditional principles of equity--that may allow a patent holder (including an essential patent holder) to obtain the appropriate value for its invention when a licensee is unwilling to negotiate reasonable terms.\"[11] ', 'As AAG Delrahim has pointed out, the New Madison approach has taken hold in the U.S. and abroad.[12]  For example, the Department joined the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office and the National Institute of Standards and Technology in releasing an updated Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments, which replaced a prior statement on patent remedies that was issued in 2013.[13]  This Joint Statement restored balance to the debate over the availability of injunctions for infringement of SEPs by advocating that no special rules on remedies need apply, such as those limiting injunctions.  This well-received policy change was the product of thoughtful work by staff and leadership at DOJ, PTO, and NIST--all three Executive Branch agencies whose missions are relevant to standards development. ', \"We see the courts embracing the New Madison approach as well.  As you may know, the Department has expanded its advocacy in federal district courts, filing statements of interest that called for the sound application of antitrust law to intellectual property disputes.  For example, in FTC v. Qualcomm, the Ninth Circuit accepted the Department's view that a refusal to license its competitors a SEP and charging its customers what some perceived to be unreasonably high royalties do not alone violate the Sherman Act.[14]  Similarly, in Continental v. Avanci,  the district court accepted the Department's view that alleged breaches of FRAND obligations do not constitute exclusionary conduct giving rise to monopolization claims and recently granted a motion to dismiss in that case.[15]  In Intel v. Fortress, the district court declined to accept a theory that the antitrust laws barred the defendants' efforts to acquire and monetize patent rights absent a cogent theory that the acquisitions eliminated competing patents, rejecting the plaintiffs' overbroad market definition.[16]  The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice; Apple and Intel have now amended their complaint and we are watching this case with interest.  Recent rulings by courts in the United Kingdom and Germany similarly recognize that standards essential patent holders must be able to enforce their patents and recoup investment on their contributions to standards development.[17]\", \"In Lenovo v. Interdigital, the Department filed a statement of interest advocating that a single firm's allegedly anticompetitive FRAND breach does not satisfy Section 1's concerted-action requirement.  In addition, we argued that over-disclosing standard-essential patents during the standards development process, without more, generally does not violate Section 2.[18]  In all of these cases, the Department's analysis focused on whether the alleged conduct could harm competition or the competitive process, rather than the price of the royalty. \", \"Some other general principles can be gleaned from this advocacy work and other related efforts of the Division.  First, antitrust law is not a panacea for all disputes involving the licensing of standards-essential patents--it does not favor individual competitors or groups of competitors, but focuses on harm to competitive process.  For example, in analyzing Avanci's licensing pool for SEPs for use in 5G-connected vehicles, pursuant to the business review process, the Department found that although the pool did not license to automotive suppliers, the pool's license to vehicle manufacturers had the potential to make licensing easier and much more efficient for automakers willing to license the technology necessary to make these vehicles.[19]  The Department also the found the pool could help to ensure cellular technology innovators are compensated appropriately for the value that their technology brings to connected vehicles. \", 'Our review of the Avanci 5G pool focused on the potential harms to competition that might be created by the platform and determined that the potential benefits outweighed the potential harms.  In doing so, the Division did not take sides in the \"license to all\" versus \"access to all\" debate over where in the manufacturing chain a SEP holder must license to avoid antitrust liability.  We made clear that the Department is not in the business of choosing winners and losers.[20]  Thus, we made no assessment of whether end-device licensing will be or should be successful in the automotive industry or whether it is the correct approach to licensing in these sectors.  Rather, we focused on the pool\\'s potential to aggregate a significant number of complementary cellular SEPs in the marketplace and streamline licensing, and found that it is unlikely to harm competition.[21]  As the Department\\'s letter explains, if Avanci successfully streamlines licensing for both automakers and SEP holders, this means that both groups may be able to focus resources elsewhere, such as on investment in further R&D in emerging 5G technologies and applications--which is likely to benefit consumers.[22] ', 'Second, balance is important to maintaining incentives to compete and contribute technology to standards.[23]  Our business review response to the GSM Association emphasized the importance of balance in maintaining a competitive standards development process.[24]  It made plain that an open and balanced standards process is central to preserving competition and enabling the emergence of new disruptive technologies.[25] Indeed, \"maintaining a balance of interests in the standard-development process is a critical safeguard that helps to prevent competition concerns from arising in the standard-development process.\"[26]  ', 'Third, antitrust law has a role to play in ensuring concerted action and special interests do not harm a competitive standards development process.  The Department has engaged directly with standards development organizations (SDOs) on this issue.  As an example, we recently submitted comments to the American National Standard Institute (\"ANSI\") on its revisions to the U.S. Standards Strategy.[27]  Again, our comments emphasized the importance that balance brings to the standards development process.  The Division\\'s ANSI comments note in particular that competition among technologies to be included in global standards will not flourish if certain players are allowed to \"bias [the] standards development processes in their favor.\"[28] ', 'The Division also stressed the importance of balanced policies and participation in recent advocacy to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (\"IEEE\").  The Department took the step of issuing an update to 2015 IEEE Business Review Letter after numerous concerns were raised by stakeholders and former government officials that the 2015 Letter was being misrepresented or misinterpreted as an endorsement of the IEEE\\'s Patent Policy, which was not the point of the 2015 Letter (again, the Department does not pick winners and losers).  In addition to addressing mischaracterizations of the 2015 Letter, as AAG Delrahim has explained, the supplemental letter \"reiterates that SDO policies and procedures must balance the interests of SEP holders and implementers\" as well as \"afford parties the flexibility needed to arrive at license terms (like royalty rates) that encourage participation in the SDO process.\"[29]  We also updated the 2015 Letter to reflect recent cases that more clearly articulate that FRAND disputes are better addressed under contract or patent law, rather than antitrust.', 'Although the Department has been largely successful in its New Madison approach and in advocating these central principles, not everyone has accepted them, and there is still work to be done.  For the remainder of my time, I would like to focus on some policies outside the United States, particularly in China, that could pose a threat to competition and innovation in standards development.', 'As noted by AAG Delrahim in a speech at a conference last month, the Division keeps a close eye on global developments relating to the intersection of IP and competition.  Indeed, the issue of SEPs will be the basis of a discussion at the next meeting of the Competition Committee of the OECD. ', \"A jurisdiction that we follow particularly closely is China.  While China's antitrust enforcement regime is fairly new and recently reorganized, China has ramped up enforcement of its Antimonopoly Law (AML) quickly.  We have heard concerns over the years that China's enforcement of the AML targets foreign firms, and promotes industrial policies and national champions.  We have been and will continue to be quite clear--industrial policy and national interest should play no role in competition enforcement, and the Department routinely engages with Chinese enforcers on application of the AML to advocate non-discriminatory enforcement.  Indeed, procedural fairness in competition enforcement is an issue of particular importance to the Division.  In 2018, the Department worked closely with competition enforcers and the International Competition Network (ICN) to develop the Framework on Competition Agency Procedures, or CAP. [30]  Through this innovative arrangement over 70 competition agencies around the world have committed to fundamental due process protections in competition enforcement, and the signatories held their first meeting virtually last week.  It is unfortunate that China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), which enforces the AML, has not yet signed the CAP.  We hope that status changes as our dialogue with Chinese enforcers continues.\", 'The Antitrust Division also is interested in how the AML is applied to conduct involving intellectual property.[31]  This summer, the State Council Anti-Monopoly Commission issued its long-awaited Guidelines on Intellectual Property Rights.[32]  Some of the principles set forth in Guidelines are welcome and well-accepted.  In fact, we apply them in the U.S.  For example, similar to our IP Guidelines,[33] Article 2 of the Chinese guidelines provides that intellectual property should be analyzed in the same manner as other property rights and that enforcers will not presume that an intellectual property right (including a standards-essential patent, see Chinese guidelines, Article 27) creates market power.  Moreover, Chinese enforcers are to analyze conduct for procompetitive benefits on a case-by-case basis.[34] ', 'Aspects of the Chinese guidelines apply specifically to standards development.  For example, the Chinese guidelines recognize that standards development organizations should not become vehicles for concerted action by market participants to harm competition.  We wholeheartedly agree.  Under Article 11, Chinese enforcers will examine whether collective standards development excludes competitors, competing standards, or relevant proposals of particular companies without procompetitive justifications. ', 'While the Chinese adoption of these principles should be applauded, other aspects of the Chinese guidelines are more concerning.  For example, an intellectual property holder with a dominant market position may violate the AML if it charges an excessive royalty (Article 15), refuses to license an essential intellectual property right or one that is subject to a licensing commitment (Article 16), or if it discriminates in licensing terms (Article 19).  Indeed, for standards-essential patents, the Chinese guidelines state seeking an injunction or forcing a licensee to accept unreasonable licensing terms may restrict competition and violate the AML (Article 27). ', \"We have argued against these concepts over the past several years in many fora, because we believe they put companies at risk of violating the antitrust laws when they merely seek to enforce their patents.  And this can chill innovation.  For example, in our view, a competition agency that regulates royalties simply because it determines they are unfairly high risks severely reducing firms' incentives to innovate.  Under U.S. antitrust law, lawful monopolists may set their prices as high as the market will bear.  The potential for high reward encourages dynamic competition and drives the desire to create a better, more desirable product or service.  The freedom to set prices relates to the freedom to license.  We believe the unilateral choice to refuse to license confers greater benefits to the innovator than if it were forced to share with competitors.  Having this choice creates incentives for the initial investment.[35]  In the case of patent royalties, including those for standards-essential patents, prices are best set by agreement between licensors and licensees.  If they can't agree, then arbitration or other similar methods may help to resolve the dispute.  In contrast, intervention by competition enforcers regarding the price of licenses can undermine the benefits of the market and result in the misallocation of investments.  \", \"We understand that not all competition enforcers agree with our perspective, but we think continued discussion of these issues is critical.  If soundly applied, competition law can work in concert with intellectual property rights to enhance innovation and economic growth.  In addition, transparent and procedurally fair enforcement procedures advance incentives for innovation by providing companies with confidence they are operating in a stable, predictable, and fair environment.  We intend to monitor how China's IP Guidelines are applied and will continue to engage with the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on these topics.\", \"Another issue at the intersection of competition and standards we are watching with interest is China Standards 2035, which is a new industrial plan being developed by the Chinese government to advance China's position as a key contributor and influencer of global standards, including those that are critical to our infrastructure and national security such as 5G.[36]  Although a draft of the plan has not been published, we understand that China Standards 2035 will be a complement to China's successful Made in China 2025 strategy, which has established China as a leader in global manufacturing in strategic industries such as communications technology.[37]  China Standards 2035 seeks to internationalize Chinese standards and aggressively incorporate Chinese technologies into global standards. \", 'China\\'s National Standardization Committee issued a report earlier this year confirming that China\\'s strategy is to influence international standards development and have more Chinese technologies included in global standards, such as those related to information technology, biotechnology, and COVID-19 response.[38]  China\\'s reported goals reflect its recent efforts to gain prominence in standards development for emerging technologies.[39]  In short, it appears that \"Beijing intends to set the foundational rules that will define next-generation technologies, resources, and exchange writ large.\"[40] ', \"China Standards 2035 follows complaints we have heard about China's domestic standards development, which is State-run rather than industry-led.  For example, companies have complained that they are unable to access Chinese standards, or that they experience roadblocks to participating in the domestic process even if they have a presence in China as well as the technical expertise.  In addition, we have heard that companies may have their technology incorporated into a domestic standard without their participation or consent.  In our engagement with Chinese regulators, we have emphasized that standards development should not exclude foreign stakeholders and that contribution of intellectual property to a standard must be voluntary.\", 'Engagement with China on China Standards 2035 will be important given the plan\\'s potential implications for competition in the standards development process.  While the antitrust laws support and encourage competition in standards development because it can result in better standards, any success of Chinese companies should be because their technologies are better on the merits, not because of China\\'s use of industrial policies, including China Standards 2035, that further its goal of having Chinese companies and Chinese interests dominate the development process internationally.[41]  Controlling the standards process in this way diminishes the benefits that collaboration brings to setting standards in a balanced, consensus-based manner.  To be sure, China Standards 2035 has the potential to thwart the procedural protections and international norms that SDOs have in place to promote openness and balance in the standards development process.[42]  International norms require, among other protections, impartiality and consensus, including the opportunity to \"to contribute to the elaboration of an international standard so that the standard development process will not give privilege to, or [favor] the interests of, a particular supplier/s, country/ies or region/s.\"[43] ', 'As I mentioned, China Standards 2035 also has the potential to harm competition; for example, China\\'s plan may have an effect similar to a concerted effort by a group of competitors to control the outcome of the standards development process.[44]  Although \"private standards can have significant procompetitive advantages,\" the Supreme Court has emphasized that SDOs must promulgate them \"through procedures that prevent the standard-setting process from being biased by members with economic interests in stifling product competition.\"[45]  International SDOs must be cognizant of this threat and respond as necessary.  As the Department states in its GSMA letter, \"without balancing interests of different members there is little value in a group having openness, due process, or an appeals process, as there would be no diversity of opinion that would leverage such principles into reaching consensus.\"[46]  SDOs must ensure that special interests and the priorities of any one member or group of members do not dominate SDO processes and outcomes.  We understand that organizations such as ANSI are engaging with China on this plan as well as China\\'s other initiatives in the standards development area, and we hope these discussions are fruitful. ', 'The Administration\\'s recent National Security Strategy for Critical & Emerging Technologies (C&ED), issued last month, addresses similar threats to technology development, including from China.  It encourages the US Government to \"lead the development of worldwide technology norms, standards, and governance models that reflect democratic values and interests\" and \"engage with the private sector to benefit from its understanding of C&ET as well as future strategic vulnerabilities related to [critical and emerging technologies].\"[47]  Indeed, such engagement will be important to ensuring that standards continue to promote interoperability and facilitate global commerce.[48]  As I have explained previously, the entire process of developing standards should adhere to due process principles so as to ensure that standards development does not advantage a particular country, region, or interest group.[49]  Ideally China will seek comment on a draft of China Standards 2035 so that stakeholders can share their experience with standards development, including in the United States.  As you know, the United States Government favors an industry-led, consensus-based approach--one that is embraced internationally.[50] ', 'In sum, I believe competition enforcers have an important, though arguably limited, role to play.  We must continue our global engagement at the intersection of intellectual property, competition, and standards, including with China, as we have on these and other important issues.[51]  All stakeholders in standards development must continue to favor open, balanced, and fiercely competitive standards development processes that result in the adoption of merits-based solutions.

      "['Broke. . . but Not No More: Opening Remarks--Innovation Policy and the Role of Standards, IP, and Antitrust', 'Thank you to LeadershIP for putting together this panel on \"Innovation Policy and the Role of Standards, IP, and Antitrust.\" Some of you know that I often give my remarks the title of a popular song. Teddy Swims has a wonderful song released within the last few weeks called \"Broke\" and the first verse contains the lyrics: \"Broke . . . but not no more.\" These lyrics have special meaning with respect to antitrust law and policy as they relate to patent licensing practices, which for many years were broken, stifling competition, but are now being restored to their proper role of fostering a competitive and innovative economy.[1]', 'I am honored to join you, Director Kappos, and to discuss with my colleagues, Under Secretaries Iancu and Copan, the role that each of our agencies plays in fostering an innovative, competitive American economy. This is the first time we have been able to get all three of us together since we signed the new joint Policy Statement on Remedies for SEPs Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments in December 2019.', \"That day marked a milestone in the Antitrust Division's New Madison approach to the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property law, and so I'd like to use today as an opportunity to point out some additional milestones the Antitrust Division has accomplished related to competition and innovation since that time and to identify challenges on the horizon.\", 'I. The New Madison Approach', \"I'll start by briefly reminding everyone of the basics of the Division's New Madison approach:\", 'As many of you know, some IP and antitrust scholars are concerned about what they call a \"hold-up\" problem in the licensing of Standards Essential Patents--known as SEPs. Standards Development Organizations--called SDOs--establish standards so that devices and software can interoperate. Standards play an important role in numerous industries, including medical devices, wireless communications, and airlines parts, among others. The standards let consumers seamlessly integrate technology from different manufacturers without the need for complex workarounds. SDOs often require patent holders who want the SDO to consider their technology for use in the standard to agree at the outset that, if their patent is selected, they will license it to implementers on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. This is known as a FRAND commitment. The supposed \"hold-up\" problem is that SEP holders might renege on their FRAND obligations after their patents are incorporated into the standard. They may demand non-FRAND terms from implementers who need to use their technology to be standard-compliant. Furthermore, there is a radical theory that a patent holder who fails to live up to his FRAND commitment can be sued for an antitrust violation for that alone.', 'The New Madison approach has four core premises: First: hold-up is fundamentally not an \"antitrust\" injury, but rather a contract or fraud injury, when it is proven. Second, SDOs should not become vehicles for concerted action by market participants to favor implementers over patent holders. Third, a fundamental feature of patent rights is the right to exclude, and courts should be hesitant to limit that right by, say, disfavoring injunctive remedies, absent specific congressional direction. Fourth, consistent with the right to exclude, the antitrust laws ought to regard a unilateral decision not to license a patent as per se legal.[2]', 'The competitive process in this context takes place in the negotiations between implementers and patent holders.  Negotiating in the shadow of dubious antitrust liability is not only unnecessary, it dramatically shifts bargaining power between patent holders and implementers in a way that distorts the incentives for real competition on the merits through innovation. Giving implementers the threat of treble damages in antitrust increases the perverse likelihood of \"hold-out,\" which is the other side of the \"hold-up\" coin. Of course, none of this undermines the importance of the negotiations that took place at the time that an SDO selected competing technologies for inclusion in the standard.  To the extent that implementers bargained for some benefit, contract law already provides a solution to the problem of patent holders failing to live up to that bargain. The parties are on equal terms when they bargain in the shadow of contract law, because there is no threat of treble damages skewing the negotiations in favor of the implementer.', 'II. New Madison in the Courts, U.S. and Abroad. ', \"In addition to the 2019 Joint Policy Statement, which I know we'll be discussing as part of the Q&A later, the Antitrust Division has offered our New Madison approach in courts that are currently hearing challenges on these issues. I'll highlight a few of the cases in which we've filed recently.\", 'This past February, we filed a statement of interest in the Northern District of Texas in Continental v. Avanci, a case that presented the question whether a patent holder who has made a FRAND commitment can be sued for violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act.[3] Plaintiff Continental Automotive Systems alleged that defendant Avanci made and then reneged on FRAND commitments. Continental sought treble damages under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which restricts the conduct in which a monopolist can engage.', \"Our filing explained that Continental's Section 2 claims based on alleged breaches of FRAND commitments in the standard setting context do not sound in antitrust law. Using the antitrust laws in this way is both bad policy and inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent that sharply limits any antitrust obligation to deal with a competitor.[4]  We're currently awaiting the judge's decision on the defendant's motion to dismiss.[5]\", \"We made a similar point in our filing in Lenovo v. Interdigital in July in the District of Delaware. Lenovo went so far as to argue that reneging on FRAND commitments violates not only Section 2 of the Sherman Act, but violates Section 1 as well. Our brief explained that Section 1 of the Sherman Act imposes liability only for concerted action, and that making and reneging on a FRAND commitment is unilateral action that involves no coordination with any other party. Interdigital's motion to dismiss is currently pending. Recently, both Interdigital and DOJ alerted the court of the Ninth Circuit's holding in Qualcomm that reneging on FRAND commitments is not an antitrust violation.\", 'Another important filing that we made as part of our New Madison project is an amicus brief we filed jointly with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office last October in the 5th Circuit Case, HTC v. Ericsson. HTC, the implementer that brought the suit, advanced a rule that reasonable licensing rates for SEPs have to be based not on the revenues for the entire product, but somehow on the value of the smallest saleable patent practicing unit--that is, the smallest independent part of the product that could be said to infringe.  HTC also argued that any license that imposed different costs on distinct licensees was unacceptably discriminatory.', 'We urged the Fifth Circuit to reject both of these rigid rules. The first rule--that licensing fees had to be based on the value of the smallest saleable patent practicing unit--prevents a patent holder from introducing evidence of how actual licensing fees work in practice. Where freely negotiating parties in the market base their licensing arrangements on revenue from the product, there is no reason why courts should categorically exclude such considerations.', \"The second rule HTC proposed--that a disparate impact makes a licensing fee discriminatory--would make almost any licensing arrangement discriminatory. No implementer is identically situated to its competitors, and any license arrangement is liable to have different effects on differently situated companies. The PTO presented oral argument in May, and we're now awaiting a decision.\", 'In March we filed a statement of interest in Intel v. Fortress, which is being litigated in district court in the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs Intel and Apple based their complaint on a novel--and problematic--understanding of antitrust law. They argued that Fortress and the other defendants had violated the antitrust laws by acquiring a large portfolio of patents and aggressively enforcing them. Our filing highlighted the absence of any harms to competition in the complaint. The complaint failed, for example, to identify any instances where the defendants had acquired substitute patents; that is, where their acquisitions might have eliminated competition. ', 'Moreover, in that case, the plaintiffs defined the relevant market as the \"Electronics Patent Market.\" We explained why the alleged \"Electronics Patent Market\" is vastly overbroad and could not constitute an antitrust-relevant market. The products in any valid market have to be substitutes for one another; or at least there has to be some cross-elasticity of demand. Electronics patents, of course, cover many unrelated technologies that don\\'t substitute for one another. The judge agreed with our analysis and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. Apple and Intel have now amended their complaint. We\\'re watching this case with interest.', \"The Division's filings in these cases--Continental v. Avanci, Lenovo v. Interdigital, HTC v. Ericsson, and Intel v. Fortress--are examples of how the Division can advance a carefully balanced pro-innovation approach and be useful to courts. The intersection of intellectual property and antitrust is a highly technical area of law. When we weigh in on these issues, we aim to improve courts' understanding of the law which, ultimately, will benefit consumers and competition. \", 'Importantly, courts have been echoing our concern for the proper balancing of the interests of patent holders and implementers. Furthermore, courts have rejected antitrust lawsuits premised solely on the violation of FRAND commitments.', '            The Ninth Circuit\\'s recent decision in FTC v. Qualcomm is a strong and important pronouncement of the correct approach to antitrust in the standard setting context.[6] As the Court put it, \"the FTC . . . does not satisfactorily explain how Qualcomm\\'s alleged breach of [the] contractual [FRAND] commitment itself impairs the opportunities of rivals.\"[7] Moreover, the Ninth Circuit emphasized that it did not want to go beyond the Aspen Skiing case in establishing a duty to deal with rivals.[8]  It is encouraging that the Ninth Circuit understood these important but highly complex issues, and explained them clearly.', \"We have also seen strong international recognition of the New Madison approach's fundamental principles. In this past spring's Sisvel v. Haier decision from the German Federal Court of Justice, the Court made clear that implementers have to do their part in negotiations over SEPs.[9] Under Sisvel, implementers have to be willing to take a license on any terms that are fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.\", \"Implementers also must take an active role in negotiations. In the Sisvel case, Haier, the implementer, did not make counter-offers during negotiations, but merely repeatedly rejected Sisvel's offers, stating that the terms were not FRAND. This behavior indicated that Haier was not negotiating in good faith, and the German high court indicated that implementers have to make offers of their own; they cannot just reject successive offers claiming that no offer has been made on FRAND terms.\", \"            The Federal Court of Justice also held that the mere fact that the patent holder had offered better licensing terms to a different entity didn't make the offered terms discriminatory. Sisvel had offered a large discount to Haier's competitor Hisense, but didn't offer the same discount to Haier. Sisvel argued that it had been pressured by the Chinese government to offer the discount to Hisense, but that shouldn't mean that any higher offer to Haier was discriminatory. The German High Court held that pressure from a foreign government was a valid reason for offering different rates.\", \"            The UK Supreme Court's recent decision in Unwired Planet International v. Huawei Technologies is another foreign court decision that largely aligns with New Madison principles and, in particular, with the 2019 Joint Policy Statement.  This example of convergence around a principle that was already starting to emerge as consensus in the United States is especially welcome to me, since one of my other priorities as Assistant Attorney General has been seeking international convergence for the rules governing competition around the world. \", 'In Unwired Planet, the UK Supreme Court held that SEP holders may be entitled to injunctive relief and are not limited to seeking monetary damages. The defendants argued that injunctive relief should be categorically unavailable with regard to Standards Essential Patents, but the UK Supreme Court noted that this would severely disadvantage patent holders. Here is what the Court said:', '\"[I]f the patent-holder were confined to a monetary remedy, implementers who were infringing the patents would have an incentive to continue infringing until, patent by patent, and country by country, they were compelled to pay royalties. It would not make economic sense for them to enter voluntarily into FRAND licences. In practice, the enforcement of patent rights on that basis might well be impractical . . . . An injunction is likely to be a more effective remedy, since it does not merely add a small increment to the cost of products which infringe the UK patents, but prohibits infringement altogether.\"[10]', \"            The UK Supreme Court took another position that we welcome--and that aligns with the German high court's Sisvel decision: A patent holder is not required to offer to each implementer the best terms that it has offered to any previous implementer in order to comport with FRAND obligations. In Unwired Planet, Huawei, the implementer, argued that it should not be forced to pay more for the technology in dispute than Samsung, another implementer, had paid. But the Court pointed to the economic literature on the benefits of price discrimination, and held that differential pricing is not necessarily discriminatory pricing. The holder of an SEP has to negotiate with all comers, but is not required to offer all implementers precisely identical terms.  This reasoning recognizes the principle I mentioned earlier: competition is taking place when patent holders and implementers negotiate.  Courts are increasingly aware that they should respect those competitive dynamics and limit their own distortionary effects.\", \"            It is this recognition from courts, as well as watching these negotiations and litigations play out over the last several years, that led us to the most recent milestone in the Antitrust Division's New Madison approach: just earlier today we announced an updated supplement to the Antitrust Division's 2015 IEEE Business Review Letter.           \", 'We took this step to address the updated legal and policy landscape, as well as incorrect uses of the 2015 letter both at home and abroad. The letter we issued today reiterates that SDO policies and procedures must balance the interests of SEP holders and implementers and consider incentives for hold-up and hold-out behavior, and afford parties the flexibility needed to arrive at license terms (like royalty rates) that encourage participation in the SDO process. Our newly issued letter will help end any misuses of the 2015 Letter and, in doing so, establish more accurate antitrust policies both at home and abroad.', 'III. Future Challenges: China Standards 2035 and Beyond', 'While the New Madison approach has seen important successes for a free-market and innovation-driven antitrust policy, challenges remain on the horizon. One potential concern that is especially relevant to this audience is the recently revealed China Standards 2035 initiative, which is slated for release later this year. It appears that China Standards 2035, like Made in China 2025 before it, aims to promote Chinese interests--perhaps even if doing so means forgoing selection of superior technologies in the development of standards that will govern consumer experiences throughout the world. Critics have noted that this approach has led to market access barriers and other harms.[11] This approach may also ignore obligations China has to evolve or conform to international standards.[12] ', \"Made in China 2025, to achieve its stated goals, is criticized for tending to subordinate free market principles. Instead, it reinforced government control and intervention, preferential policies, and financial support for domestic innovation and for acquisition of foreign technology.[13] While the final China Standards 2035 document has yet to be released, it is largely expected to take a similar approach and to accelerate China's efforts to establish itself as a key decision maker and influencer of global standards.[14]  This would likely include efforts to exert greater control over both processes and outcomes.\", \"Standards processes can be susceptible to capture by specialized interests. This capture comes at the expense of consumers. The Division has seen the negative effects of biased processes firsthand. Where they arise, we will not hesitate to investigate and bring an enforcement action.  Our GSMA investigation relating to the use of eSIMs, which culminated last year in the organization revising its standard-setting processes, demonstrates that the Antitrust Division will act where a preference for certain stakeholders' interests tend to result in diminished innovation and worse consumer experiences.\", 'When global private standards processes are competitive and merits-based, they benefit consumers both domestically and abroad. The Antitrust Division, along with numerous domestic and international partners, has worked diligently for many years to foster a global standards development environment that promotes competition and innovation.', 'Earlier this week, we at the Antitrust Division encouraged American National Standards Institute to consider strengthening its commitment to globally accepted principles for standards development--like transparency, openness, and impartiality--in its revision to the U.S. Standards Strategy.[15] ANSI has played an important role in helping to foster a procompetitive environment for global standards development, and it can continue doing so by warning of the dangers from allowing special interests to dominate SDO processes and outcomes.', 'IV. Conclusion', \"            I will conclude by emphasizing the considerable success we have seen from the proper interpretation of antitrust enforcement. We've assisted courts by filing amicus briefs, and we have seen important judicial decisions both at home and abroad that make sure that patent holders and implementers are on an even playing field in negotiating licensing rates that both reward innovation and encourage new applications of technologies. There are certainly challenges, both domestic and international, that remain. It is, however, my hope that the Antitrust Division's innovative responses to 21st century legal problems will maintain important incentives to innovate and help ensure continued technological progress.   \", ' ', '[1] See Makan Delrahim, Assistant Attorney General - Antitrust Division, \"The times they are a\\'changin\\'\":', \"The Nine No-No's in 2019 (Oct. 21, 2019), available at https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/1213831/download.\", '[2] Makan Delrahim, Assistant Attorney General - Antitrust Division, The \"New Madison\" Approach to Antitrust and Intellectual Property Law 5 (Mar. 16, 2018), available at https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/1044316/download.', '[3] Continental Auto.

Li also used various means to conceal his unlawful conduct, including by sending and receiving payments using accounts that did not appear connected, at least publicly, to companies trafficking in illicit products.  Li and his customers would also agree to mislabel packages, break up shipments into separate components, alter destination addresses and use multiple forwarding companies based in the United States.

      "[\"Note: To read more about the Attorney General's announcements below click here, here, and here. \", 'Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Thank you, Justin, for that kind introduction.  Thank you for your eight years of service to the Department of Justice, as well as your service in the Air Force, the Navy Reserve, and as an Assistant D.A. in Manhattan.\\nIt is an honor to be here with my fellow prosecutors and law enforcement officers to make some announcements about one of the most important issues we face: our fight against the opioid epidemic.\\nBut first, I want to thank the outstanding leadership team standing behind me today:', '\\nI especially want to thank all of the federal officers who are here with us today, who do so much to fight opioid trafficking in Ohio, across state lines, and even international lines.  That includes:', \"\\nAnd while we are inexpressibly proud of our fabulous federal officers, we also understand and appreciate the fact that 85 percent of the law enforcement officers in this country serve at the state and local levels.  And so I want to thank all of our state and local officers who are here today.  You are the ones in the trenches every day gathering the street-level intelligence that can lead to national and even international cases.\\nAnd we are sadly well aware that Ohio at is the center of the drug epidemic.  In 2016, Ohio was second in the nation in overdose death rates, with a rate nearly double the national average.\\nOur goals at the Department are to reduce crime, reduce homicides, reduce prescriptions, and reduce overdose deaths.  To achieve them, we are working to drive up the cost of drugs and bring down their supply, purity, and availability.\\nAs one part of his plan President Trump has set the ambitious goal of reducing opioid prescriptions by one third in three years.  According to the National Prescription Audit, over the past year we reduced prescriptions by 11 percent. That's in addition to a 7 percent decline in 2017.\\nAnd while 2017 saw a continuing rise in overdose deaths from 2016, the most recent data show a possible leveling off of overdose deaths.  We have a lot of work left to do, we are beginning to see progress. And we are continuing to step up our aggressive efforts.\\nOver the past year, I have sent 10 more prosecutors to Ohio.  One is dedicated exclusively on prescription drug fraud.  Two focus on fighting the trafficking of synthetic drugs.  More prosecutors will mean more cases, more convictions, and ultimately safer communities.\\nBefore I say anything else, I want to remind everyone that the defendants in these cases--as in every case--are innocent until proven guilty.  The allegations that I will present today are just that: allegations.\\nToday, I am here with a series of dramatic announcements that reveal the determination of this administration and this Department of Justice to take strong action to combat the grip of death and destruction that has taken hold of our country and in particular this office's aggressive leadership here in Ohio that is set to turn the tide on this plague.\\nSix months ago, I announced the Department's Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force, which coordinates our criminal and civil actions to fight the opioid crisis at every level of the supply chain--from manufacturers to distributors to doctors to pharmacies to street dealers and gangs.\\nPresident Trump has directed me to take civil action against drug companies when it is warranted by law--and I will do so.  I will also bring criminal charges where appropriate.\\nToday, thanks to the PIL Task Force, I am announcing the first ever civil injunctions under the Controlled Substances Act against doctors who evidence indicates prescribed opioids illegally.\\nThese injunctions - a temporary restraining order - will stop immediately these doctors from prescribing--without waiting for a criminal prosecution.\\nBoth doctors in these cases are from Northern Ohio.\\nDr. Michael Tricaso works in Akron and Painesville and is accused of selling thousands of dollars' worth of narcotics without a legitimate medical purpose.  He allegedly sold them to an undercover DEA agent in a hotel parking lot over a series of three months.  These pills include Percocet.  Dr. Tricaso also allegedly wrote prescriptions for an undercover DEA agent and two DEA sources for steroids and Percocet without legitimate medical purpose.\\nThe second doctor is Dr. Gregory Gerber of Sandusky--who the complaint alleges prescribed countless opioids without a legitimate medical purpose and who caused the submission of false claims to Medicare Part D, the prescription drug section.\\nThe complaint for the injunction charges that he prescribed oxycodone to an undercover agent who never said that she was in pain.  According to the allegations, Dr. Gerber allegedly ordered no tests and performed only a minimal physical examination.  This happened on seven different occasions over seven months.  Eventually he doubled the dosage and the strength of the pills.\\nThe charges also allege that this doctor accepted $175,000 in kickbacks from a company that makes a fentanyl drug intended for cancer patients, a drug he prescribed to patients who did not have cancer.\\nWe seek to deny these doctors the authority to continue prescribing drugs.  In the lawsuit, we seek up to $700,000 in damages from Dr. Tricaso.  Our initial estimates of Dr. Gerber's alleged false claims to Medicare total 2.8 million taxpayer dollars.  We will seek at least triple the total in damages.\\nMy second announcement today is an important case involving Chinese fentanyl trafficking.\\nToday I am announcing a 43-count indictment by the Northern District of Ohio team of the leaders of the Zheng drug trafficking organization. The indictment charges a man known by the alias of Gordon Jin and his father. \\nThese traffickers allegedly manufactured--in China--more than 250 types of synthetic drugs, including synthetic opioids and deadly fentanyl analogues that they distributed in the United States and around the world.\\nUsing an elaborate system of shell companies, the Zheng organization allegedly shipped synthetic opioids to locations in more than 25 countries and 37 U.S. states, including Ohio.\\nThe man who is charged with serving as the American reshipper for Zheng has already been arrested. He was caught with while trying to flee the country and has pled guilty.\\nLast April, a career drug dealer from Akron and his girlfriend were sentenced to a total of 30 years in prison for selling fentanyl that took the life of Thomas Rauh of Akron.\\nShortly after his arrest, Ohio officers contacted the suppliers he had used online and then purchased fentanyl analogues from them.  That led us straight to the Zheng organization.  We now believe that the drugs that killed Thomas Rauh and 23-year old Carrie Dobbins originated with the Zheng organization.\\nWe also allege that the Zheng organization manufactured counterfeit drugs that purported to be Adderall and discussed manufacturing various trademarked cancer drugs, but were fake. They were actually bath salts.  Adulteration of medicine with synthetic drugs would of course be illegal in both the United States and China.\\nAs we fight this scourge, our law enforcement agencies will count on the cooperation of China's Ministry of Public Security, and we will look to the Government of China to schedule fentanyl-related substances as a class, as the US has done.\\nMy third announcement arises from Operation Darkness Falls, a joint operation against dark net fentanyl traffickers by the FBI, the IRS, our Postal Inspectors, and Homeland Security Investigators again right here in Northern Ohio.\\nToday I am announcing that this office has charged a husband and wife--who at the time of their arrest were the most prolific dark net fentanyl vendor in the United States and the fourth most prolific on Earth.  They were known online as MH4Life.\\nLast July, the Department of Justice seized Alpha Bay, which was the largest dark net marketplace in history. \\nThis site hosted some 220,000 drug listings and was responsible for countless synthetic opioid overdoses, including the tragic death of a 13 year old. \\nMH4Life allegedly used Alpha Bay and at least eight other darknet sites to sell opioids and other deadly drugs.  On one of their profiles, they advertised more than 3,000 completed drug sales.\\nUndercover agents made controlled purchases from MH4Life on the darknet.  Through coordinated efforts with our Postal Inspectors, the packages they received were traced to a post office in San Antonio and the woman mailing them was identified.\\nShe and her husband were observed carrying large bags of envelopes that matched the ones used to send drugs to undercover agents. \\nSurveillance followed the woman as she attempted to purchase hundreds of dollars of gift credit cards with cash, a tactic commonly used by money launderers. \\nFederal agents executed simultaneous search warrants on the hotel room and the residence the next day.  They observed M holding suspected heroin, many pages of drug ledgers in both of the defendants' handwriting, encrypted electronic devices, and passwords used for third-party payment websites.  \\nAgents found drugs packaged for distribution, large quantities of cash, counterfeit currency, a gun, and cryptocurrency hard wallets. \\nSince then, no one has logged on to the MH4Life accounts and no shipments have been sent.\\nOperation Darkness Falls has also led us to indict at least five others.\\nThat includes a man who allegedly was the third-largest dark net fentanyl vendor in North America at the time of his arrest--a man known online as DF44.  He was arrested with the help of our allies in Canada. \\nA search warrant led to a fentanyl stash room that was right next to his daughter's playroom.  After his arrest, the defendant posted bond and then committed suicide.\\nWe have also indicted a major Xanax dealer known online as The Source, or BonnieNClyde.  When he was arrested, we seized more than $438,000 in bitcoin.\\nFourthly, the Northern District of Ohio team has obtained indictments of a dark net fentanyl dealer who ran his business in an apartment that was just down the street from Our Lady of the Lake Catholic school in Euclid.  Two weeks ago, he pled guilty and is due to be sentenced this fall.\\nLastly, a grand jury here  indicted two other dark net fentanyl vendors, one of whom recently pled guilty and is expected to receive a 10-year sentence.\\nI want to remind the public once again that the defendants in all of these cases are innocent until proven guilty. My statements are allegations.\\nBut let's make one thing clear: Today's announcements are a warning to every trafficker, every crooked doctor or pharmacist, and every drug company, every chairman and foreign national and company that puts greed before the lives and health of the American people: this Justice Department will use civil and criminal penalties alike and we will find you, put you in jail, or make you pay.\\nJustin, you and your team are doing outstanding work for the people of Ohio and indeed this nation.  Drug trafficking is an international business.  The effects of these cases will be felt from coast to coast and around the world.\\nAnd so I want to close where I began: by thanking the outstanding law officers who played a role in each one of these actions that I have announced today.  Officers at the federal, state, and local levels in Ohio and across the country made these indictments possible.  These cases may have saved lives already.  These officers have shown us once again that no nation on Earth has a finer group of law officers than we have here in the United States. \"]\n",

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Chairman Marino, Ranking Member Cicilline, and Members of the Subcommittee:', 'Thank you very much for inviting me here to testify on the work of the Civil Division (the Division) of the Department of Justice (the Department). I have led the Division since Jan. 30, 2017, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the work of the Division and its budget and resource needs for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.', 'The Division represents the United States, its agencies, Members of Congress, Cabinet officers, and other Federal employees. Approximately 87 percent of its cases involve defending claims filed against the government. This litigation reflects the diversity of government activities, involving, for example, challenges to Acts of Congress and actions of the Executive; national security issues; benefit programs; energy policies; commercial issues such as contract disputes, banking, insurance, and intellectual property; all manners of accident and liability claims; and enforcement of immigration laws. In FY 2016, well over $1 trillion was at issue in defensive suits alone.', \"The Division also brings affirmative cases involving, for example, fraud, debt collection, and civil and criminal violations of consumer protection laws. This work plays a critical role in achieving the Attorney General's priority of combating waste, fraud, and abuse. Since 1986, the Division, working with U.S. Attorneys across the country, has returned tens of billions of dollars to the federal Treasury through civil and criminal judgments and resolutions in affirmative cases. This amount includes more than $53.6 billion recovered by the Division and the U.S. Attorneys under the False Claims Act. Last year alone, the government recovered more than $4.7 billion under the Act--the seventh straight year that the Department has recovered more than $3 billion of taxpayer funds. Similarly, in each of the last seven fiscal years, the government's health care fraud recoveries have equaled or exceeded $2 billion. In addition, in FY 2016, the government recovered more than $6.6 billion from banks and other financial institutions making false statements and claims.\", 'The Division is currently made up of more than 1,350 employees, including over 1,000 attorneys. Each year, Division attorneys handle tens of thousands of cases that collectively involve billions of dollars in claims and recoveries. The Division confronts significant policy issues, which often rise to constitutional dimensions, in defending and enforcing various federal programs and actions. The priorities of the Division include strengthening the security of our nation, protecting the health and safety of consumers, and pursuing fraud against the government and in the financial sector.', 'National Security', \"Defending the nation remains the highest priority of the Department. Although other parts of the Department have a more visible role in this effort, the actions of the Civil Division are no less vital to its success. Whether those actions entail the defense of national security laws and regulations, litigating and defending of the U.S. Government's immigration actions, defending restrictions placed on assets and activities within the United States of individuals or entities tied to foreign terrorist organizations, or the litigation of habeas petitions brought by known or suspected terrorists, Division attorneys are dedicated to the protection of the American people.\", \"The Division's efforts in recent years to defend national security have taken a number of different forms, including:\", 'Supporting efforts to counter the continuing threat of terrorism, the Division has, among other things, successfully defended the validity of a cause of action against state sponsors of terror and also defended against Bivens lawsuits against law enforcement officers and high-level government officials arising out of efforts to protect national security.', \"The Division's Office of Immigration Litigation has successfully prevented known or suspected terrorists from becoming naturalized citizens, defended against habeas corpus petitions seeking the release of known terrorists, suspected terrorists, or aliens of unknown backgrounds pending further review, and sought to revoke the naturalizations of known or suspected terrorists, violent criminals, and human rights abusers.\", \"The Division has defended against district court challenges and immigration-related appeals involving aliens who have engaged in or committed terrorist activities, espionage, and atrocities, and helped train hundreds of Assistant U.S. Attorneys; and over 3,000 agents assigned to the FBI's (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Forces.\", \"The Division has litigated cases relating to the security of our borders, aviation system, and the homeland; defending against constitutional challenges to screening procedures for individuals entering the United States, the government's No-Fly List and Selectee List used for screening airline passengers and crew, broader uses of the government's terrorist watchlists used for border and security screening, and the restriction on photography at border points of entry.\", 'Similarly, the Division has also defended litigation filed against government agencies charged with ensuring the safety and security of the U.S. financial system, as well as the integrity of the U.S. economic sanctions program.', 'The Division has continued to defend habeas petitions arising out of the detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay.', 'The Division is also currently defending against constitutional and statutory challenges to the activities of the National Security Agency, including pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act under which the government may collect, subject to supervision by the FISA court, certain communications of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States.', 'The Division represents the agencies of the U.S. Intelligence Community in the protection of national security information in several different settings, including claims raised under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and discovery requests made in civil litigation, as well as through enforcement of prepublication review requirements on persons who had access to classified information.', 'The Division also handles litigation concerning military personnel policies, including lawsuits challenging the implementation of policies that opened combat positions to women, as well as challenges to existing statutory male-only draft registration requirements.', 'The Division has also pursued affirmative claims against government contractors and others that failed to abide by national security related restrictions, or who violated immigration and customs rules.', 'Health and Safety', \"The Division has placed a special emphasis on pursuing conduct that threatens the health and safety of American consumers, including the misbranding or adulteration of drugs, the distribution of tainted food, and the sale of unsafe goods. The Division also prioritizes pursuing false claims that target federal health care programs and threaten the safety and well-being of our citizens. Although the most visible efforts of the Division in this area are those lawsuits that result in large monetary judgments or settlements, the impact of the Division's work cannot be measured solely in dollars and cents. It must also take into account the effect of the Division's work preventing and deterring the actions of those who seek to harm consumers and the healthcare system upon which they rely.\", \"Fighting fraud against federal health care programs is a pivotal element of the Division's work to protect consumer health and safety. The Department's Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) increases coordination and optimizes criminal and civil enforcement among agencies. Through enforcement actions under the False Claims Act, and aided by the efforts of HEAT, the conclusion of FY 2016 marked the seventh straight year the Department has obtained $2 billion or more in health care fraud recoveries. All told, the Department has recovered more than $34 billion in federal health care dollars since 1986.\", \"A significant component of the Department's health care fraud caseload has historically consisted of cases alleging misconduct by manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, as well as hospitals and home health care providers.\", 'The pharmaceutical industry continues to account for a substantial part of the Division\\'s health care fraud recoveries. For example, in January 2017, Shire Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay $350 million to settle federal and state False Claims Act allegations that it, and the company it acquired in 2011, Advanced BioHealing (ABH), employed kickbacks and other unlawful methods to induce clinics and physicians to use or overuse its product \"Dermagraft,\" a bioengineered human skin substitute approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Similarly, in March 2016, Olympus entered into a $623.2 million settlement to resolve criminal charges and civil claims for paying kickbacks to doctors, including consulting payments, foreign travel, lavish meals, millions of dollars in grants and free endoscopes, to induce the purchase of its equipment. The settlement included $310.8 million to settle civil claims under the federal and various state False Claims Acts to resolve the company\\'s liability to government health care programs. In June 2016, the Department announced a $67 million settlement with Genentech Inc. and OSI Pharmaceuticals to resolve allegations that they made misleading statements about the effectiveness of the drug Tarceva to treat non-small cell lung cancer.', \"Some of the Division's largest recoveries in the past year, however, were from other sectors of the healthcare industry. For example, in October 2016, Tenet Healthcare, a major U.S. hospital chain, agreed to pay $368 million to resolve civil claims relating to a scheme to defraud the United States and to pay kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. The settlement with Tenet was part of a $514 million global resolution that resolved both civil and criminal liability. The same month, Lifecare Centers of America, a company that owns and operates skilled nursing facilities, paid $145 million to resolve allegations that it caused skilled nursing facilities to submit false claims to federal healthcare programs for rehabilitation therapy services that were not reasonable, necessary or skilled. The Division also spearheads the Elder Justice Initiative, which coordinates and supports law enforcement efforts to combat elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation by maintaining an information bank of Elder Justice related materials, funding medical reviewers to assist Department attorneys in pursuing nursing home cases, and coordinating nationwide investigations of skilled nursing facilities.\", \"The Division's efforts to protect consumer health have also prompted a focus on the unlawful sale of certain dietary supplements. In November 2015, the Department and its federal partners announced that they had pursued civil and criminal cases against more than 100 makers and marketers of dietary supplements. Those actions, including federal cases in 18 states, resulted from a year-long effort to focus enforcement resources in an area of the dietary supplement market that has been causing increasing concern among health officials nationwide. In each of the cases, the Department or one of its federal partners has alleged the sale of supplements that contain ingredients other than those listed on the product label or the sale of products that make health or disease treatment claims that are unsupported by adequate scientific evidence.\", 'Financial Fraud', \"The Division's efforts to combat financial fraud have most directly focused on enforcement against those bad actors that either take advantage of vulnerable consumers or wrongly deplete the federal fisc. And the harm caused by such fraud often extends beyond the specific victim - whether a consumer, an investor, or the Federal Government. On a broader scale, such fraud jeopardizes investors, markets, and the economy as a whole. The Division is dedicated to holding accountable those actors that threaten the integrity of our financial system.\", \"That commitment has been demonstrated by the Division's efforts to target multiple aspects of fraud that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. One facet of that fraud involved actions by financial institutions to knowingly approve mortgages that did not meet federal requirements, putting people into homes that they could not afford. When these mortgages failed, the Federal Government was required to cover the losses - a practice that led to the depletion of the crucial Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance fund. In the last year, the Division, as part of a collective enforcement effort with our partners in the U.S. Attorney's Offices, has recovered nearly $1.7 billion - the second highest annual recovery in this area. As part of the settlement agreements, the financial institutions admitted the conduct that gave rise to the government's investigations.\", \"The Department has continued its pursuit of claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) arising out of the packaging, marketing, sale and issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS. In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to settle federal and state civil claims for $7.2 billion, Credit Suisse agreed to settle similar claims for $5.2 billion, and Moody's agreed to resolve federal and state investigations into its ratings practices for nearly $864 million. In prior years, the Department reached resolutions with JPMorgan ($13 billion), Bank of America ($16.6 billion), Citibank ($7 billion), Goldman Sachs ($5 billion), and Morgan Stanley ($2.6 billion).\", \"The Division remains committed to aggressive investigation and prosecution of corporate wrongdoing, including the Department's policy of ensuring individual accountability. That policy recognizes that one of the most effective ways to deter corporate wrongdoing is by holding to account the individuals responsible for the corporate malfeasance.\", \"Division also continues to prioritize cases where it can prevent ongoing harm. In September 2016, for example, as part of an ongoing effort to dismantle international mass-mailing fraud schemes, the Department, along with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, and other law enforcement agencies, announced wide-ranging enforcement actions. actions included criminal charges, economic sanctions, seizure of criminal proceeds, and civil injunction lawsuits. This effort disrupted mass-mailing schemes that collectively have defrauded millions of elderly and vulnerable victims across the United States out of hundreds of millions of dollars. actions were part of a broader effort to attack fraud schemes targeting older Americans and other vulnerable populations that involve individuals and entities across the globe, including Canada, France, India, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States.\", 'Other Fraud Recoveries', 'Although healthcare and financial fraud recoveries have remained predominant during this period, the Division has continued to aggressively pursue fraud wherever it is found in Federal Government contracts, grants, and programs.', \"For example, the Division recovered $125 million from several companies under contract to design and build the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) at Department of Energy (DOE)'s Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. The settlement resolved allegations that the companies violated the False Claims Act by charging DOE for deficient nuclear quality materials, services, and testing. The Division also settled with CA Inc. for $45 million for allegedly overcharging government agencies for information technology. In April 2017, the United States obtained a $31 million judgment against Eric C. Conn, a lawyer who represented claimants seeking social security disability benefits, and his law firm, for violating the False Claims Act by submitting fraudulent medical records to prevail on disability appeals and by submitting false claims forms to obtain fees from the social security program.\", 'The Department also resolved claims against BP Exploration and Production Inc. (BP) under the False Claims Act for $82.6 million in connection with the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon/Macondo Well explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The government, through the Department of the Interior, leases portions of the Outer Continental Shelf to companies like BP that explore for and develop oil and gas resources. In exchange for the lease, the holders pay royalties based on the volume of oil or gas produced from the wells. Program regulations applicable to exploration of the Outer Continental Shelf require well operators to maintain a \"safe drilling margin.\" The settlement resolved allegations that BP\\'s reports to the government about drilling margin concealed the company\\'s improper drilling, which left the well in a fragile state and contributed to the blowout. Resolution of the government\\'s civil fraud claim was part of a more than $20 billion two-settlement package that included a federal consent decree and a related state settlement. The federal decree secured, among other things, civil penalty and natural resources damage recoveries. The Gulf States were party to that decree and also to the companion settlement between the Gulf States and BP that resolved state claims for economic damages.', 'Additionally, the Division recovered more than $50 million in customs fraud during the last year. U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects duties on imports of foreign goods to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition abroad by leveling the playing field for domestic products. Importers who seek an unfair advantage by knowingly evading or reducing their obligation to pay these duties are subject to damages and penalties under the False Claims Act. These recoveries both address lost duties and safeguard U.S. markets. For example, in April 2016, the Division settled for $15 million allegations that Z Galleries avoided paying duties on wooden bedroom furniture imported from China by misclassifying the furniture.', \"In addition to these and other recoveries, the Division represents the government in a number of lawsuits alleging fraud that were either initiated or continued in FY 2016. For example, the Division continues to litigate claims against Kellogg, Brown & Root (KBR) and foreign subcontractors in connection with KBR's contract with the U.S. Army to provide wartime logistical support. The government has alleged that KBR employees took kickbacks in return for awarding subcontracts at inflated prices for services and equipment that were often deficient or not provided at all, as well as other false and inflated claims. The Division is currently litigating claims against DynCorp ternational Inc., alleging that the contractor knowingly submitted inflated claims in connection with a State Department contract to train Iraqi police. In addition, the Department joined a qui tam lawsuit which alleges that Inchcape Shipping Services Holdings Limited and certain of its subsidiaries knowingly overbilled the U.S. Navy to supply goods and services to ships at ports throughout the world. The Division is also continuing to pursue against IT contractor Symantec claims similar to those that it settled with CA c.\", 'Defending Federal Statutes and Programs', \"The Division has primary responsibility for defending the constitutionality of statutes passed by Congress. Accordingly, the Division has led the Department's response to a number of recent challenges on issues of national significance. For example, the Division has defended a constitutional challenge to the recently enacted International Megan's Law, which imposes travel notification requirements on sex offenders; the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires certain hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment without regard to a patient's ability to pay; the nondisclosure provisions of the National Security Letter statutes and of the USA FREEDOM Act; as well as many other statutes. The Division has also successfully defended protections for service members under the Military Lending Act from predatory lending practices. The Division has also defended several facial constitutional challenges to the America Invents Act of 2012, which comprehensively reformed the patent laws, as well as the Lanham Act's prohibitions against registering disparaging and scandalous trademarks.\", \"The Division also defends the interpretations of statutes and the policies and actions of the Executive Branch. In that role, the Division has handled numerous high-profile lawsuits, including in recent constitutional and statutory challenges to the President's Executive Orders and in appellate and district court proceedings that challenge agency rulemaking efforts. The Department also routinely defends decisions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concerning the approval of generic drugs, ensuring that there are incentives for developing new products and that there can be price competition for safe and effective medicines.\", 'Protecting the Federal Fisc', \"The Division represents the United States, including its officers and agents, in suits for money damages. In 2015, 2016, and 2017 to date, the Division's work has helped the government to avoid billions of dollars in damages sought by obtaining favorable judgments or negotiating settlements for less than the full amount of a plaintiff's claim.\", \"Currently, for example, the Division is defending against claims relating to the government's actions in 2008 and 2009 to address the economic crisis. In one case, the Division defended the United States in a class action on behalf of shareholders of the American International Group (AIG), who sought tens of billions of dollars based on allegations relating to the government's 2008 rescue of AIG. After the trial court concluded that the shareholders were not entitled to compensation, but that the government had nevertheless acted unlawfully, appeals and cross appeals were taken. The court of appeals recently vacated the trial court's decision, holding that the shareholders lacked standing to bring their claims. Similarly, the Division is representing the government in multiple lawsuits brought by shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac challenging the government's actions in connection with conservatorships of those entities. The Division is also defending the United States against claims for more than $8.3 billion bought by insurance companies seeking payment under the risk corridors provision of the Affordable Care Act. The Division is also defending a series of claims brought by auto dealers whose dealership agreements were terminated when General Motors and Chrysler declared bankruptcy. Finally, in its bankruptcy litigation practice, the Division protects the United States' fiscal interests by ensuring that government claims are paid in accordance with the priority scheme of the bankruptcy code. The Division is currently protecting the United States' financial interests in numerous bankruptcy cases filed by energy companies that suffered losses related to the recent drop in energy prices.\", 'Defending Immigration Actions', \"The Division defends and prosecutes civil immigration matters in federal court. The Division's Office of Immigration Litigation represents the government in cases in the federal courts of appeals challenging determinations that an individual is subject to removal from the United States or is not eligible for some form of relief that would allow him or her to remain in the United States. These cases represent approximately 10 percent of all cases filed in federal appellate courts, with the Division handling more than 4,800 new filings in FY 2016 and more than 3,000 to date in FY 2017.\", 'The Office of Immigration Litigation also handles immigration cases at the district court level in all of the 94 federal district courts nationwide on behalf of several agencies and has primary responsibility for handling appeals arising from immigration-related cases in the district courts. These include the Department of Homeland Security and HHS in cases involving a wide range of complex immigration matters, the Department of State in cases involving passports and visas, the Department of Labor in employment-related labor certification programs, and the FBI on immigration-related national security matters, including denaturalization and other actions involving known or suspected terrorists, violent criminals, fraudsters, and human rights abusers. The Office of Immigration Litigation has also defended numerous cases brought by known or suspected terrorists and convicted criminals attempting to acquire immigration benefits, circumvent admissions procedures, thwart removal, or avoid mandatory detention pending removal.', \"The Office of Immigration Litigation also handles class action cases challenging critical policies and programs relating to the Federal Government's interpretation, administration and enforcement of immigration law.\", \"President's Budget Request\", \"The President's FY 2018 request for the Division seeks 1,140 positions (833 attorneys) and $291.75 million including an increase for immigration litigation. This request consists of the resources required to maintain the superior legal representation services that have yielded such tremendous success. We hope the House and Senate will fully fund the Division's FY 2018 request.\", 'At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to address any questions you or Members of the Subcommittee may have.']\n",

Mahan of the District of Nevada ordered defendant Dmitriy V. Melnik, 30, of Las Vegas, remit $200,000 in restitution and forfeit $1.2 million in proceeds derived from the scheme as well as property seized during the investigation.  Melnik pleaded guilty before Judge Mahan on Sept. 8, 2016, to one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and to introduce into interstate commerce misbranded devices.  ', \"According to the plea agreement, Melnik imported large quantities of colored contact lenses from the People's Republic of China and South Korea that he knew were counterfeit and/or unauthorized by the FDA for sale in the United States.

Melnik admitted, however, that he sold purportedly \"authentic\" contact lenses to tens of thousands of customers around the United States without a prescription, adequate directions for use or adequate warnings.  After purchasing the contact lenses, many customers complained directly to Melnik about the quality of the contact lenses and questioned Melnik about whether the contact lenses were genuine and FDA approved.  Melnik admitted that many of the contact lenses that he sold were substandard, and that some were tested and found to be contaminated with a potentially dangerous bacteria.  ', 'As stated in the plea agreement, a substantial part of the fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States, and Melnik received at least $1.2 million in gross revenue from this illegal enterprise, including approximately $200,000 alone from the sale of counterfeit Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS.', 'Anyone with information about individuals committing intellectual property offenses can report those crimes to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center by going to http://www.iprcenter.gov/referral or calling (866) IPR-2060.', \"The prosecution is the result of an ongoing multiagency effort to combat counterfeit, illegally imported and unapproved contact lenses called Operation Double Vision.

And, just last year, on his own trip through the region, President Obama - who, as you may know, spent some of his childhood years in Indonesia - spoke of the future of the Asia Pacific region as one of \"security, prosperity, and dignity for all\" and one in which America - as a \"Pacific nation...will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future, by upholding core principles and in close partnership with our allies and friends.\"', \"This evening, I'm proud to echo President Obama's message of partnership - and to express my nation's dedication to working alongside critical allies like Singapore to promote peace, opportunity, and prosperity throughout Asia. And I am privileged to be a part of the Obama Administration's broad engagement with this region as we address new ways to confront serious legal issues and to combat cross-border crimes.\", \"At a time when we must constantly adapt and respond to unconventional and transnational threats - and do so in ways that honor our most basic and fundamental freedoms - I believe that we can be encouraged by how our nations have responded. By working in common cause, in good faith, and with mutual respect, our countries have come together to bring dangerous criminals to justice, to identify and prosecute international organized crime networks, to uncover and dismantle illegal human trafficking rings, and to investigate global financial fraud schemes. And we've made significant progress in more effectively sharing information and resources, and in elevating our international law enforcement efforts.\", \"Especially in the decade since the September 11th attacks - which were attacks not just against the United States, but against our shared ideals and all free societies - we can be proud of how our two nations have assisted one another. Over the last decade, our governments - and those of our allies across the world - have launched and advanced collaborative efforts to reinforce our judicial and law enforcement cooperation. And we've done this on a scale the world has never known before. In these historic efforts, we have seen time and again that - just as our security interests are intertwined - our counter-terrorism efforts must be, as well. And in fighting terrorism, we have renewed our commitment to ensuring that protecting the safety of our citizens does not mean compromising our determination to uphold civil liberties - and we've proven the effectiveness of such an approach.\", \"Cybercrime presents challenges no less daunting. In recent years, we've witnessed a dramatic rise in cybercrime, which has  threatened not only national security, but also the integrity of governments and the safety of our citizens.  In this new era of seamless commerce and instant communication, we've seen businesses prosper and innovation thrive unlike ever before. But the cutting-edge technologies that we now rely on have also created new vulnerabilities. And a growing number of criminals are actively seeking to exploit them in ways that can inflict  significant, lasting harm on innovators, consumers, and entire countries. \", 'Cybercrime knows no boundaries - attacks launched in Southeast Asia can disrupt financial systems in America; counterfeit products manufactured in China can be made available for sale to anyone on the Internet. And cybercriminals can now operate beyond the reach of traditional law enforcement mechanisms - using technology to steal information and commit financial fraud half-a-world away; and, with just a keystroke, can mount cyber attacks against infrastructure networks that span numerous countries. No nation - and no government - is immune to these increasingly destructive and widespread threats.', \"That's why today - more than ever before - our nations must work together with a renewed commitment to fight cybercrime, and an unyielding resolve to protect our common values, including personal privacy and personal freedom.\", \"During my tenure as Attorney General, I have been honored to work with some of the leaders here today - and many others across this region - to navigate the way forward, and to help strengthen law enforcement cooperation so that we can meet today's challenges - and anticipate tomorrow's. Over the last three years, the U.S. Justice Department has deepened its bilateral engagement with partners around the world, raising awareness of shared cyber threats, and forging a sustainable path forward to confront these issues head-on. And in my meetings with counterparts in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, Hungary, and Germany, we've started a critical dialogue with government and industry leaders to combat cyber crime on a global scale - with a global strategy.\", \"Within the Justice Department, we've redoubled our efforts to assist our allies through mutual legal assistance in cyber cases. And by increasing outreach and exchange programs for overseas judges, prosecutors, and investigators, we have taken our international law enforcement efforts to the next level, sharing ideas and strategies with essential global stakeholders unlike ever before. Over the past six years, for instance, the Justice Department has participated in cyber or IP enforcement training and education programs for more than 12,000 prosecutors, investigators, judicial officers, and other officials from more than 30 countries. We've stepped up our robust enforcement efforts with international partners. And we've assembled innovative task forces to investigate and prosecute a variety of these crimes, including corporate and state-sponsored economic espionage that makes use of the Internet and cutting-edge technologies.\", \"In recent years, I'm encouraged to see the global community responding to these challenges with historic collaboration, sharing resources across borders, working to avoid duplicative efforts, and - most importantly - successfully identifying and stopping cybercrimes wherever and whenever they arise.\", 'Let me take a moment to highlight the most important of these international collaborations in fighting cybercrime: the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. For more than a decade, the Convention - which is open to accession to countries outside the Council of Europe, and which the United States has joined - has proven to be a critical instrument in confronting the ever-evolving crimes committed in cyberspace, including crimes involving copyright infringement and network security, computer-related fraud, and child pornography. With its mutual legal assistance framework, and its provisions that ensure signatory nations have the tools to fight cybercrime, the Budapest Convention is the key to fighting cybercrime on a global scale.', \"And we are beginning to see momentum growing as more nations join the Budapest Convention. Japan ratified the Convention earlier this month; and we hope that Singapore - which is a world leader on cyber issues - will likewise join the Convention. That's all the more reason why institutions - like this Academy - must continue to drive forward critical discussions about ratification, keep working to f ind solutions to problems of both national and global consequence - and help maintain efforts to forge and strengthen international alliances that, quite frankly, have never been more important.\", \"Beyond the Convention, I'm hopeful about the other coordinated efforts that are currently underway to promote even greater investment and awareness in the area of cyber security. The proposed opening of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation right here in Singapore - scheduled for 2014 - will undoubtedly provide a critical boost to overall international security and ongoing law enforcement operations in the region - by enhancing police training, forensic analysis, and database capabilities for our nations and our partners around the globe.\", \"But - no matter where this work takes us - one thing is already clear. Cyber threats will continue to evolve - and no single nation can stay ahead of them on its own. That's why - if we are to succeed in preventing and combating these dangers - we must come together through international frameworks like the Budapest Convention and the INTERPOL Global Complex to identify and neutralize these threats, and implement best practices to ensure the safety of our citizens and to promote the rule of law. Today, together, it's time to ask: What can we do to confront the shared threats that we face? How can we ensure that our partnership and coordination remain an example for other nations around the world? And perhaps most importantly, we must consider: how can we achieve these objectives while safeguarding civil liberties and honoring our democratic institutions? \", ' ', \"These aren't easy questions, particularly in the cyber context, which involves complex issues of personal privacy and expression. But you are among the most qualified people to help answer them. I'm grateful for your engagement - and your dedication to the responsibilities, goals, and values we share. In discussing cyber issues in the United States, we are mindful that America's origins - as well as its modern-day systems - reflect a core belief in the importance of protecting citizens from government intrusion. Our founding document - the Constitution - established a federal system of limited government, with extensive checks and balances. And our Bill of Rights ensures the freedom to speak and worship freely - and protection from self-incrimination, as well as from unreasonable searches and seizures.\", \"For over two centuries, these principles have guided leaders in my country to create a system of layered oversight and privacy protection that has become one of the most robust and effective in the world. America's experience - especially in recent years - shows that it is possible to achieve the appropriate balance between security and liberty. And its long history serves as a constant reminder that both of our nations cannot - and must not - abandon democratic values, even in the pursuit of public safety. The values are, in fact, our greatest tools for ensuring peace and security.\", \"I am assured that the protections we've already made will preserve the personal privacy rights and civil liberties for our citizens. And I am very hopeful that - as we gather tonight in Singapore, which has been an increasingly influential leader in promoting and developing the rule of law throughout Asia - this Academy will continue to lead the way in honoring that same sacred commitment to our shared principles.\", 'Despite the uncertain challenges and the many responsibilities before us, I believe that we also have a unique and important opportunity to do what is necessary and what is right; to forge ahead; and to take our collective fight against cybercrime and terrorism to a new level, while remaining vigilant in protecting our most cherished freedoms and liberties.', 'In achieving the progress we seek - and shaping the future that our citizens deserve - I am confident in our ability to enhance safety and security while promoting peace and prosperity. And no matter the challenge or the obstacle, we will continue to stand with you - and with our partners throughout the Asia Pacific region - to uphold our core principles and carry on the critical work in the years ahead.', 'Thank you.']\n",

      "['Remarks as Prepared for Delivery', 'Good morning, and thank you for that kind introduction and the invitation to speak with you.', \"One of the major activities of DOJ's National Security Division is working with our interagency partners to protect against adversaries that would exploit our country's open investment climate to harm our national security interests.  This conference is devoted to that aspect of our work, and offers an opportunity to engage with the private sector about the threats we face, the steps taken to address those threats.\", \"What I would like to discuss with you today is one specific element of our Division's foreign investment review work, which is our increasing focus on compliance and enforcement.\", 'Looking at the numbers, only very few of the transactions we review are blocked.  That does not necessarily mean the others pose no national security risk; rather, for most transactions that involve national security risk, we are successful in working with companies to craft mitigation measures that enable us to resolve the risk without resort to barring the transaction.  Our ability to negotiate mitigation agreements with parties and then monitor compliance is often overlooked in public discussions of foreign investment review, but that part of our program is absolutely crucial.  For that reason, today I would like to focus on the \"back end\" or \"compliance tail\" of our reviewed transactions, and to provide what I hope are some helpful insights into our compliance priorities and how those priorities can inform your own approach to mitigation and compliance.', \"As you are all aware, the Department of Justice's mitigation activities related to foreign investment arise chiefly in the context of two interagency groups: (1) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; and (2) the newly minted Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector.  This new committee was established this past spring by Executive Order, and formalized the process known for years as Team Telecom, but unfortunately burdened it with the nearly unpronounceable acronym of CAFPUSTSS (pronounced caf-PUSS-tiss).  Here, for ease of our conversation, I will set aside this tongue twisting acronym and instead continue to refer to the committee as Team Telecom.\", 'In both of these interagency groups, the Department of Justice and our interagency partners can usually resolve national security and law enforcement risks by negotiating mitigation measures with the transaction parties.  Those measures can range from the relatively straightforward, such as routine notice requirements to the very complex - for example, imposing certain governance restrictions.  Once memorialized in a written agreement, we monitor compliance to ensure our identified concerns remain mitigated.', 'Since 2012, the number of mitigation agreements monitored by the Department of Justice has nearly doubled, and this upward trend shows no signs of abating.  Without effective mitigation monitoring by both the government and the parties themselves, the number of reviewed transactions able to clear CFIUS and Team Telecom would be far fewer.  For this reason, robust and effective compliance programs are in the mutual interest of both government and industry.', 'Before I turn to some of the specifics of our compliance work, however, let me first discuss how compliance and enforcement have recently changed as the result of two significant reforms - first, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA); and second, the Team Telecom Executive Order.', 'COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT CHANGES IN FIRRMA', \"The passage of FIRRMA represents the most significant expansion of the Committee's authority to address national security risks in over a decade.  Less discussed, but also important, are the expanded authorities under FIRRMA to mitigate identified risks to national security.\", 'Foremost, FIRRMA now statutorily requires that mitigation agreements be effective, verifiable and enforceable.[1]  The Department of Justice evaluates all mitigation agreements through this framework, which includes determining how potential obligations and commitments will work in the real world.  In light of what motivates the transaction and the incentives of the parties, is the agreement reasonably calculated to be effective?  Can compliance with the agreement be verified?  Can the terms be meaningfully monitored and, if needed, enforced?', \"I want to highlight that for mitigation to be a feasible option, we need to have confidence that the party with whom we are engaged can be trusted.  If we have reason to believe a party will violate a mitigation agreement, we're not going to enter into the agreement and hope that our monitoring will be able to catch all violations; rather, we will have no choice to but to block a transaction.  Examples of situations that could present trust issues are a company with a history of non-compliance; or a company that is either owned by a foreign government we do not trust, or is under the jurisdiction of a government that is not subject to the rule of law and can compel that company to act in ways that violate its mitigation agreement.  All of these factors bear on the Department's evaluation of the feasibility of proposed mitigation, and should also serve as guideposts for industry as to how the Department views mitigation.\", 'Second, when a party materially breaches a mitigation agreement or order, FIRRMA creates new authorities to supplement the existing power to impose civil penalties or reopen the review of the transaction.  Those new authorities include:', 'Third, FIRRMA requires CFIUS to review existing mitigation agreements or conditions to determine if they should be amended, phased out or terminated.[3]  This authority is particularly noteworthy because, given the lengthy life span for many mitigation agreements, we now have the flexibility to adapt to unanticipated changes in technology, practices, or circumstances.', \"Finally, FIRRMA imposes on the Committee increased reporting requirements to Congress to help maintain accountability for the Executive Branch's work to mitigate cases, consistent with Congress's oversight role.[4]\", 'TEAM TELECOM EXECUTIVE ORDER', 'As many of you know, the President signed in April 2020 an Executive Order that formalizes and improves the work of Team Telecom.  This new committee will advise the FCC on national security and law enforcement concerns associated with applications for telecommunications licenses meeting certain foreign ownership and control thresholds.  With respect to enforcement, the Executive Order explicitly anticipates that Team Telecom may need to conduct reviews of existing license holders that could lead to a recommendation to revoke their licenses.  The Executive Order made the Attorney General the chair of Team Telecom, and the Department will pay particular attention to compliance with any Team Telecom mitigation agreements upon which FCC licenses are conditioned.', 'Taken together, these changes to both CFIUS and Team Telecom have laid the groundwork for a more robust and comprehensive mitigation regime, and mark an important inflection point in the approach of the Department to mitigation.', 'CHANGES TO FIRS STRUCTURE', \"A manifestation of that inflection point is the recent restructuring and expansion of the Department of Justice's Foreign Investment Review Section (FIRS), which is part of the National Security Division.\", \"Among other changes, in early 2018, FIRS stood up a dedicated compliance and enforcement team headed by a newly created Deputy Chief position.  Although many considerations informed this decision, a useful shorthand is to note that over the last decade the number of agreements monitored by the Department has increased by over 135%.  On equal footing with the teams that review the CFIUS and Team Telecom cases, the compliance and enforcement team will help ensure that the National Security Division's mitigation agreements are complied with and, when necessary, enforced.\", 'When I talk about compliance and enforcement, I want to emphasize that those two words are not viewed as synonyms within the Department of Justice, but rather as expressions of two different types of work to achieve our mitigation goals.', 'Compliance encompasses a broad range of concepts that coalesces around a cooperative relationship between the transaction parties and the government monitoring agencies.  Although we strive to keep all our mitigation efforts in this cooperative posture, we acknowledge that circumstances may sometimes necessitate a more adversarial engagement to protect our national security priorities, if parties are not complying with the mitigation requirements.', 'That is when we transition into an enforcement posture, and we believe the Department is uniquely qualified through its investigative and litigation resources to make effective use of such enforcement actions, to include seeking judicial remedies.', 'THE EVOLVING COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT LANDSCAPE', 'Partly for the reasons I just described, the Department of Justice has been at the forefront of the changing compliance and enforcement landscape.  No doubt most of you are aware of the recent emphasis by CFIUS on enforcement, reflected by two enforcement actions in which the Department of Justice played an integral role.', 'In 2018, CFIUS imposed a $1 million civil penalty for multiple breaches of a 2016 CFIUS mitigation agreement, including failure to establish requisite security policies and failure to provide adequate reports to CFIUS.  This was the first penalty imposed by CFIUS since the enactment of the Foreign Investment & National Security Act (FINSA) in 2007.', 'This penalty was followed by a $750,000 penalty in 2019 that was assessed for violations of a 2018 CFIUS interim order, including failures to restrict and adequately monitor access to protected data, as defined in the order.  The parties agreed to the penalty amount.', 'What should you know about these cases?', 'Although I cannot offer specific details, a common feature is the systemic failure to appropriately resource and support their compliance obligations.  Stated simply, these companies lacked a compliance culture up to the task of the compliance obligations they undertook.', 'Returning to an earlier point, mitigation agreements must be effective, verifiable and enforceable.  Those baseline requirements impose on companies entering into mitigation agreements - at a minimum - an obligation to weigh carefully their ability to comply with the terms.  Will the agreement be effective?', 'It is not just the government that needs to assess the answer to this and related questions.  Companies must also consider the cost of compliance, and must be willing and able to make a commitment to prioritize compliance.  Otherwise, the obligations undertaken in a mitigation agreement may wind up positioning a company for failure, and resulting in enforcement actions by the government.', 'We understand the very real financial and other costs often associated with complying with mitigation agreements.  Part of our effort is to ensure that mitigation agreements are realistic in light of the business purpose of the transaction in question (otherwise, it seems unlikely compliance will follow).  But our responsibility for protecting national security, and enforcing the agreements we reach, always takes precedence.', \"I would like to make brief mention of recent enforcement activities regarding the U.S. subsidiary of China Telecom, which is a Chinese state-owned entity.  As you may be aware from our April 2020 recommendation to the FCC, the Executive Branch agencies identified substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks associated with China Telecom's operations, which is why we recommended that the FCC revoke its licenses.  That recommendation was based on several factors, but many of them relate to the company's failure to comply with a 2007 mitigation agreement.  Other factors include the company's inaccurate statements concerning the storage of U.S. records and its cybersecurity policies.  The company's operations also provided opportunities for P.R.C. state actors to engage in malicious cyber activity enabling economic espionage and disruption and misrouting of U.S. communications.  And, it followed logically that additional mitigation terms would give us no comfort with a party we cannot not trust to follow them.  The Foreign Investment Review Section identified those compliance issues through its mitigation monitoring program.  As a result, the Executive Branch agencies concluded that the national security and law enforcement risks associated with China Telecom's international Section 214 authorizations could not be mitigated by additional mitigation terms.\", 'WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN A MITIGATION AGREEMENT', 'So what are we looking for when we enter into a mitigation agreement with you?  To give a classic lawyer answer, it depends.', 'There is, of course, no \"off the shelf\" mitigation agreement that will work with every reviewed transaction, or a menu of boilerplate provisions that need only be plugged into a template.  In the Department of Justice\\'s view, effective mitigation agreements must be tailored to the unique needs and risks identified by each transaction.  Importantly, our compliance obligations are not static, but rather ever evolving with technological changes, new business practices or any number of developments that can change our analysis.', 'There are, however, certainly some common characteristics of an effective mitigation agreement.', 'Internal Compliance Oversight', 'Mitigation agreements should contain sufficient internal compliance controls and procedures.  Although the specifics will be different for each mitigation agreement, examples include security directors and officers who are appropriately resourced to enforce compliance and are within or have direct access to senior management when issues arise.', 'External Compliance Oversight', 'Mitigation agreements should also have provisions for independent verification of compliance obligations.  In the complex business ecosystem in which many companies exist, fully appreciating the industry-specific complexities relevant to all compliance matters can be daunting.  Some of the more robust mitigation agreements will therefore employ the use of third-party monitors to assist with the specialized monitoring requirements involving such fields as accounting or information technologies.', 'Engagement with the Monitoring Agencies', 'Mitigation agreements should also provide for engagement with the monitoring agencies.  This broadly means transparent and prompt communication regarding all aspects of the material obligations undertaken in a mitigation agreement.  Put simply, we need to know when a compliance matter arises, and will need your active assistance with any necessary follow-up or investigation.  This engagement also includes commitments to support site visits, interviews of company personnel, review of responsive documents, as well as similar access requirements.  Mitigation agreements should reflect these priorities through access provisions, notice requirements and reporting obligations.  And we note that, as significant as recent CFIUS penalties have been, those penalties themselves reflect significant discounts because of the cooperation we ultimately received and other positive aspects of our relationship with the parties.', 'Related to this point, we have found at times that during negotiations transaction parties will - in the understandable desire to see the deal close - agree to mitigation measures without a complete appreciation of what those measures entail or what burdens they may involve.  From our perspective, this outcome can be avoided by ensuring those who are making the promises are communicating with those who are charged with keeping those promises.  ', 'HOW DO WE MONITOR OUR AGREEMENTS', 'This brings us to a discussion of how the Department of Justice monitors compliance with mitigation agreements.  Here again, there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approached to monitoring.  Each mitigation agreement will require a tailor-made approach that will be informed by, among other considerations, the nature of the business, the identity of the transaction parties, and any prior compliance history with CFIUS.', 'So how can we tell that parties are complying with agreements, and as a result, that mitigation is working?  As I mentioned earlier, we start with agreements that we assess will be effective if performed.  Then, we make sure parties are holding up their end of the bargain by using a number of methods. ', 'For example, we often conduct in-depth site visits.  We see this type of monitoring as central to our mission.  Site visits are not intended to be restricted to short briefings with a PowerPoint presentation in a conference room at corporate headquarters.  Instead, they may very well involve multi-day, all-encompassing visits that can include discussions with key officers and staff, inspection of physical premises, and demonstrations of relevant technologies or security features.  We are often accompanied by subject matter experts, including FBI special agents and other personnel who are able to bring their expertise to bear.  Last year alone, we conducted approximately 35 site visits, and as we continue to expand the resources of the compliance and enforcement team, we anticipate a particular emphasis will be placed on expanding the number of companies that we visit, and the frequency of our site visits across the entire portfolio, with a particular focus on those companies with compliance challenges.', 'Although the present pandemic has restricted some of our efforts around site visits, we are exploring short-term technological solutions that will allow us to continue those engagements even without in-person meetings.  To minimize travel, we have also relied on local FBI field offices and other DOJ components to provide in-person reviews when needed.', 'Another significant example of compliance measures is that we require internal security directors and security officers to have substantial independence to inform the Department of Justice when issues arise.  Internal compliance is not just a box to check, but a real safeguard for the Department - and for the companies themselves - to help ensure that companies are implementing and adhering to the promises they undertake.  These internal security directors and officers - our \"boots on the ground\" - give the Department the ability to conduct interviews, seek information, and impose additional monitoring or compliance measures under a mitigation agreement.  It is also important to note that these internal security directors and officers are most effective when companies embrace a culture of compliance, or, as I prefer, a culture of integrity, such that all employees have a ready avenue to report issues freely, without concern about retaliation.', \"As a final example, mandatory reports and notifications give us a helpful view into a company's compliance program, and whether the company has been treating compliance as a year-round exercise or as a mere deliverable that must be turned in before the year ends.  Just like a college professor, we can tell when something was thrown together at the last minute.\", 'And a quick word about changed circumstances.  Although in our efforts to assess and mitigate risk we attempt to account for the rapidly changing business and technological landscape, because our agreements may remain in force for decades, changes in business practices or new threat vectors (among others) may cause us to seek to revise our agreements to address those changed circumstances.', 'Through these mitigation measures and others, the Department of Justice seeks to craft mitigation agreements that are tailored as necessary, and we also try to think creatively when warranted about novel mitigation measures that may help enable us to resolve the national security concerns that would clear a case even in the presence of national security concerns.', 'I hope my remarks this morning have been helpful in illuminating how the Department of Justice approaches mitigation, compliance, and enforcement in our foreign investment reviews.  We have dedicated more resources to ensuring that the agreements we reach are effective at mitigating the risks that concern us and backed by a credible, long-term commitment to monitoring them for compliance.  A strong compliance and enforcement program gives us greater comfort in clearing cases that we otherwise might not be comfortable with, which, in turns, facilitates the fair and open investment climate that benefits all of us.', 'Thank you again for your kind invitation to this conference and for your time today.  I wish you all continued health, and please stay safe.  Thank you.', '[1] 50 USC SS 4565(l)(3)(C).', '[2] 50 USC SS 4565(l)(6)(D).', '[3] 50 USC SS 4565(l)(3)(B).', ' ']\n",

      "[\"Ron Rockwell Hansen, 58, a resident of Syracuse, Utah, and a former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) officer, pleaded guilty today in the District of Utah in connection with his attempted transmission of national defense information to the People's Republic of China.  Sentencing is set for Sept. 24, 2019. \", \"Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney John Huber for the District of Utah and Special Agent in Charge Paul Haertel of the FBI's Salt Lake City Field Office announced the charges.\", 'Hansen retired from the U.S. Army as a Warrant Officer with a background in signals intelligence and human intelligence.  He speaks fluent Mandarin-Chinese and Russian.  DIA hired Hansen as a civilian intelligence case officer in 2006.  Hansen held a Top Secret clearance for many years, and signed several non-disclosure agreements during his tenure at DIA and as a government contractor.', \"As Hansen admitted in the plea agreement, in early 2014, agents of a Chinese intelligence service targeted Hansen for recruitment and he began meeting with them regularly in China.  During those meetings, the Chinese agents described to Hansen the type of information that would interest the Chinese intelligence service.  During the course of his relationship with the agents of the Chinese intelligence service, Hansen received hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation for information he provided them, including information he gathered at various industry conferences.  Between May 24, 2016 and June 2, 2018, Hansen solicited from an intelligence case officer working for the DIA national defense information that Hansen knew the Chinese intelligence service would find valuable.  Hansen agreed to act as a conduit to sell that information to the Chinese.  Hansen advised the DIA case officer how to record and transmit classified information without detection, and explained how to hide and launder any funds received as payment for classified information.  The DIA case officer reported Hansen's conduct to the DIA and subsequently acted as a confidential human source for the FBI.\", 'As Hansen further admitted in the plea agreement, Hansen met with the DIA case officer on June 2, 2018, and received from that individual documents containing national defense information that Hansen previously solicited.  The documents Hansen received were classified. The information in the documents related to the national defense of the United States in that it related to United States military readiness in a particular region and was closely held by the United States government.  Hansen reviewed the documents, queried the DIA case officer about their contents, and took written notes about the materials relating to the national defense information.  Hansen advised the DIA case officer that he would remember most of the details about the documents he received that day and would conceal some notes about the material in the text of an electronic document that Hansen would prepare at the airport before leaving for China.  Hansen intended to provide the information he received to the agents of the Chinese intelligence service with whom he had been meeting, and Hansen knew that the information was to be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of a foreign nation.', 'Hansen pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to gather or deliver national defense information to aid a foreign government.  The plea agreement calls for an agreed-upon sentence of 15 years.', 'Special agents of the FBI, IRS, U.S. Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, U.S. Army Counterintelligence, and the Defense Intelligence Agency were involved in the investigation.

Paul Nakasone, and CISA Director Christopher Krebs today released the following joint statement:', '\"Today, dozens of states and local jurisdictions are hosting their own elections across the country and, less than a year from now, Americans will go to the polls and cast their votes in the 2020 presidential election. Election security is a top priority for the United States Government. Building on our successful, whole-of-government approach to securing the 2018 elections, we have increased the level of support to state and local election officials in their efforts to protect elections. The federal government is prioritizing the sharing of threat intelligence and providing support and services that improve the security of election infrastructure across the nation.', 'In an unprecedented level of coordination, the U.S. government is working with all 50 states and U.S. territories, local officials, and private sector partners to identify threats, broadly share information, and protect the democratic process. We remain firm in our commitment to quickly share timely and actionable information, provide support and services, and to defend against any threats to our democracy.', 'Our adversaries want to undermine our democratic institutions, influence public sentiment and affect government policies. Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions. Adversaries may try to accomplish their goals through a variety of means, including social media campaigns, directing disinformation operations or conducting disruptive or destructive cyber-attacks on state and local infrastructure.', 'While at this time we have no evidence of a compromise or disruption to election infrastructure that would enable adversaries to prevent voting, change vote counts or disrupt the ability to tally votes, we continue to vigilantly monitor any threats to U.S. elections.', 'The U.S. government will defend our democracy and maintain transparency with the American public about our efforts. An informed public is a resilient public. Americans should go to trusted sources for election information, such as their state and local election officials. We encourage every American to report any suspicious activity to their local officials, the FBI, or DHS. In past election cycles, reporting by Americans about suspicious activity provided valuable insight which has made our elections more secure. The greatest means to combat these threats is a whole-of-society effort.\"']\n",

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'It is my honor to speak today at the 50th Anniversary of the United States National Central Bureau for INTERPOL.  Today is a great day to celebrate the storied history of INTERPOL Washington, and recognize all of those who have contributed to its innumerable successes over its first half century.', 'It is great to see that so many important guests have come together to join this celebration, including the acting Deputy Secretary David Pekoske of the Department of Homeland Security.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) appreciates the close working relationship we share with DHS, and we are grateful for their dedicated contributions to the mission of global security.', \"In addition to recognizing DHS's important contribution to the success of INTERPOL Washington, it is great to see many Directors of INTERPOL Washington, past and present, here today who have served as great stewards for this organization over the past half century.  I want to thank current Director Wayne Salzgaber and Deputy Director Michael Hughes for their continued leadership over the important work INTERPOL Washington does every day. \", 'We are especially pleased to host this gathering in this majestic Great Hall here at the Department of Justice.  Many great Attorneys General and other leaders have graced this stage and delivered remarks that have called upon the assembled audience to forge ahead with their respective missions all in the collective goal of promoting the rule of law.  Just outside the doors directly behind us you will also find the magnificent courtyard of the Department of Justice, known as the Great Court, with its fountain reminding us all of the wisdom and integrity that flows through these hallways every single day.', 'I encourage you to take the opportunity to walk outside to experience the grandeur of this courtyard, and also to read some of the inscriptions on the interior walls - not everyone gets the opportunity or few take the time to take advantage of it.  One of the inscriptions above the entrance recites a Latin phrase, \"Privilegium Obligatio,\" the English translation of which is \"Where there is a privilege, there is an obligation.\" At the rededication of the Great Court on July 25, 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft described the meaning of that phrase to DOJ when he said: \"We have the honor and the privilege of being stewards of justice. With this privilege comes an obligation to uphold and defend the freedoms of all Americans. Today, perhaps more than at any time in our history, it is vital that we pursue this obligation vigorously, for justice has enemies in the world. Her defense is more than an intellectual exercise or an academic pursuit; it is the calling of our time.\"  All of us assembled here today have the privilege of working together in the interests of justice to do our best for the countries we represent and our global community.  With that privilege comes the obligation to exercise our authorities, both independently and collectively, consistent with the rule of law.', 'INTERPOL Washington truly exemplifies the best ideals of teamwork and collaboration in the realm of global law enforcement.  INTERPOL Washington receives sensitive law enforcement information from all 50 states and the federal government to coordinate criminal investigations and responses with the rest of the world.  It receives similar information from virtually every nation on earth to similarly aid their law enforcement efforts and help safeguard their own countries.', 'INTERPOL Washington, therefore, has been, and remains, after 50 years, the ultimate team player in the domestic and international fight against crime--and you all should be proud of that legacy.  Today, even when nations have differences on many issues, everyone can still count on the basic principle of cooperation that serves as the foundation of this organization: police helping police across the world to keep innocent people safe and bring criminals to justice. ', 'The primary mission is simple: identify, locate, apprehend and assist in the lawful extradition of fugitives subject to valid criminal prosecution in member states. The typical U.S. example follows a case pattern I saw often as an Assistant U.S. Attorney: A Boston heroin dealer, knowing that the Drug Enforcement Administration is zeroing in on him or has obtained a warrant for his arrest, flees the country to avoid prosecution.  The Boston Police Department and DEA contact INTERPOL Washington, who swiftly files a red notice to ensure the criminal does not escape justice.  When he is located, our international partners--border authorities, police, and other government officials--coordinate information.  Charging documents and arrest warrants are lodged. The extradition process is pursued and court orders and foreign ministry decisions are obtained to ensure that extradition occurs.  And ultimately, thanks to the efforts of INTERPOL Washington and the partners with whom they collaborate, the criminal is returned to the United States to face justice for committing federal crimes.', 'INTERPOL Washington works closely with law enforcement leadership from our 50 states to ensure they are receiving the most current and accurate information they can from the INTERPOL platform so that it can be deployed to fight crime and protect our law enforcement officers. They have an ongoing effort called \"FEDERATION\" that allows state queries of \"N-LETS\" to also query international criminal and wanted person data on the INTERPOL data system platform.  There are currently 14 states who have adopted this tool and more are coming on line each year.  For instance, in just the last month the state of Colorado joined those states who have adopted this tool and their queries of INTERPOL data skyrocketed from approximately 700 each month to over 330,000 just in the month of August.  This tool helps keep our officers on the streets safe and ensures that our state and local partners have every bit of information about the individual they are encountering.  ', 'Indeed, over the past 50 years, INTERPOL Washington has become much more than just an arrest clearinghouse.  The greatest testament to its tradition of cooperation and excellence is that so many governmental agencies rely on it for so much more than criminal investigation coordination.  If there is a law enforcement emergency, or even just a general public safety emergency, either inside or outside of the country, it is INTERPOL Washington that taps into this already existing communication network to address it. ', \"Whether it is identifying and locating stolen cultural artifacts, processing DNA checks of South American drug dealers, the phone location data of a child kidnapped in France, or a teenager in India posting online a threat to harm himself, it is INTERPOL Washington that often gets the call from our domestic and international partners.  Earlier this year, the USNCB's Operations Center was contacted by the NYPD who reported they received a 911 call from a concerned citizen who received a text message from a family member on vacation in Chile.  The NYPD reported that the vacationing family member had texted their relative in New York the latitude and longitude of their small boat which was disabled off the coast during a site seeing cruise.  Evidently, the vessel did not have any way of communicating with rescue personnel on shore as the vessel had lost power.  The USNCB took this information and dispatched it to authorities in INTERPOL Santiago, resulting in the Chilean authorities locating the distressed vessel and rescuing eight U.S. citizens and two Chilean nationals.   \", 'This episode shows that INTERPOL Washington lives up to its reputation for being there when countries need each other, and for being there always: a law enforcement agency that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.  INTERPOL Washington takes no days, hours, or even minutes off.     ', 'But as we look forward to the next 50 years, there are many challenges ahead.  Illegal fentanyl importation from foreign countries has threatened the health and safety of United States citizens.  Fentanyl is now the top cause of drug overdose deaths, and drug overdose is the top cause of death in the United States for people under the age of 50.', 'Cyberattacks and crime imperil our privacy, property, and even national security.  Cyber actors destroy computer systems, steal data, engage in cyberfraud, violate personal privacy, infiltrate critical infrastructures, and pursue malign foreign influence operations. ', 'And consistent with that dilemma, we now must pursue criminal organizations that have found ever more inventive ways to enshroud their misdeeds in digital encryption or the \"dark web.\"  Child pornography, firearm trafficking, narcotics dealing, contract killings, illegal weapons sales and other serious crimes often thrive in these zones of anonymity and darkness.', \"However the Department addresses these criminal issues of our time, we recognize INTERPOL Washington's unique importance as part of the international solution to these problems.  INTERPOL Washington is the principal avenue to consult, interface, and speak with our international law enforcement partners on these critical issues.  INTERPOL has taken the lead in new human trafficking initiatives, as well as developing projects to address the opportunities and threats posed by drone technology.  As we have in the past, we will continue to call on INTERPOL Washington to help us confront the criminal problems of this era.  \", 'In addition to these criminal threats, it is important to acknowledge the threat to the institution of INTERPOL itself posed by countries that abuse its trust and seek to misuse its capabilities. Over the past few years, it is well documented that countries have issued red notices for political dissidents who have committed no real crime except to speak out against the government of their country.  We cannot allow INTERPOL to be weaponized against journalists, dissenting voices, and oppressed minorities.  We must ensure, with your help, that INTERPOL remains a system designed to catch those who seek to escape criminal justice, not those who endeavor to escape persecution.', 'In recent years, it appeared that system was in peril.  In October 2018, a month before the INTERPOL general assembly, its President--Meng Hongwei of China--disappeared after leaving INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France for his home country.  His wife reported him missing, while media reported that Chinese authorities had snatched him as part of some undescribed \"investigation.\"', \"The sudden arrest of the President of this prominent international law enforcement organization symbolized the trouble posed by individuals and countries who do not respect the rule of law and the legal order of INTERPOL.  In the vacuum caused by the President's sudden disappearance, many reported that Russia sought to fill the vacancy caused by his absence by having their own candidate elected President, thereby seeking to take control of the leadership of Interpol.   Much uncertainty fell over the future of the organization in the weeks that preceded the 2018 general assembly. \", \"Serving as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the time, I can attest to our Department's commitment and contribution to preserving the integrity of this organization and the rule of law that underpins its existence.  When the time for the General Assembly came last November, our former Deputy Attorney General (DAG), Rod Rosenstein, gave an impassioned speech to the INTERPOL General Assembly in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\", 'He spoke about many of the same subjects and issues discussed today.  He identified the peril of cyberattacks.  He spoke of the concealment of crimes on the dark web.  But he principally spoke of the global rule of law--and its importance to sustaining INTERPOL and the countries that comprise it.  He related that the rule of law was essential to the function of criminal justice throughout the world, and to the function of this great organization that was built upon the trust that those who commit crimes will be brought to justice, no matter where they are.  In these remarks, DAG Rosenstein reminded the General Assembly, and all of us, of the obligations that we owe to this organization. ', \"This speech, notably, took place under the shadow of the alarming void in the President's office, the increased abuse of the red notice system by some nations, and the designs of an ambitious sovereign who saw INTERPOL as a possible tool to deploy against domestic and foreign enemies.  However, in the face of such dire threats, the members of this great organization stood up and voted in favor of maintaining the rule of law by electing an Interpol President who will work with the rest of the body to maintain its integrity and promote its appropriate deployment of law enforcement cooperation.  Indeed, the election of current President Kim Jong Yang stands as a crucial victory for maintaining and advancing the rule of law through the righteous operation of this important global law enforcement body.\", 'Accomplishing what has been called in the American press a \"diplomatic victory,\" would not have been possible without the strong leadership of Director Wayne Salzgaber over INTERPOL Washington.  From my personal involvement in the efforts, I know it was Director Salzgaber who spearheaded the effort to mobilize resources and relationships from DOJ, DHS, Congress, and the State Department to accomplish the result we achieved.   ', 'INTERPOL Washington should not rest on its laurels.  We must stay vigilant to ensure that this venerable institution remains the bulwark of international justice. ', 'You all have accomplished so much over the last 50 years.  Thousands of criminals all over the world have been extradited and brought to justice for crimes committed against innocent people in countries across the globe.  Lives have been saved.  International relationships have been built and maintained. ', 'Thank you all for a half century of professionalism, cooperation, law, order, and justice.  As we enter the next half century, we are all assured that this great institution, with the proper international support and in the best traditions of advancing global rule of law, will continue to deploy all the tools it has at its disposal to accomplish its mission and keep our country, our international community, and fellow citizens safe.']\n",

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', 'Good Morning.', \"Thank you all for being here this morning.  I would like to offer particular thanks to Fordham University for hosting this Conference and this morning's opening ceremony.  As a native New Yorker, it is always nice to have a good excuse to be in the City.\", 'I would also like to thank the New York Division of the FBI for their work in putting on this Conference.', 'Of all that has changed over the last 30 years, cyber-related issues and cybersecurity may well be the most significant difference between my first tenure as Attorney General and this one.  Since taking office in February, I have spent a significant amount of time getting up to speed on the developments in this important area.  And I have been both impressed and reassured as I have learned about all of the investment and effort that makes the FBI a leader in this area.', 'As individuals and as a nation we have become dependent on a vast and expanding digital infrastructure. That, in turn, has made us vulnerable to cybercriminals and foreign adversaries that target that infrastructure. The danger cannot be overstated, and enhancing cybersecurity is a national imperative -- one shared by the private sector whose networks, data systems and products are at risk, as well as the government agencies charged with securing our critical national infrastructure and guarding our citizens against criminal activity.  Among the most critical advances in cybersecurity has been the development of advanced encryption techniques and their deployment in a range of important applications.  Encryption provides enormous benefits to society by enabling secure communications, data storage and on-line transactions. Because of advances in encryption, we can now better protect our personal information; more securely engage in e-commerce and internet communications; obtain secure software updates; and limit access to sensitive computers, devices, and networks.', \"As the Federal Government, we welcome these improvements to privacy and security, and will work to preserve and strengthen them.  But at the same time, we must recognize that our citizens face an array of threats to their safety far broader than just cyber threats. Hackers are a danger, but so are violent criminals, terrorists, drug traffickers, human traffickers, fraudsters, and sexual predators.  While we should not hesitate to deploy encryption to protect ourselves from cybercriminals, this should not be done in a way that eviscerates society's ability to defend itself against other types of criminal threats.  In other words, making our virtual world more secure should not come at the expense of making us more vulnerable in the real world.  But, unfortunately, this is what we are seeing today. \", 'Service providers, device manufacturers and application developers are developing and deploying encryption that can only be decrypted by the end user or customer, and they are refusing to provide technology that allows for lawful access by law enforcement agencies in appropriate circumstances.  As a result, law enforcement agencies are increasingly prevented from accessing communications in transit or data stored on cell phones or computers, even with a warrant based on probable cause to believe that criminal activity is underway. Because, in the digital age, the bulk of evidence is becoming digital, this form of \"warrant proof\" encryption poses a grave threat to public safety by extinguishing the ability of law enforcement to obtain evidence essential to detecting and investigating crimes. It allows criminals to operate with impunity, hiding their activities under an impenetrable cloak of secrecy. As you know, some refer to this eclipsing of the Government\\'s investigative capabilities as \"going dark.\" While encryption protects against cyberattacks, deploying it in warrant-proof form jeopardizes public safety more generally.  The net effect is to reduce the overall security of society.  I am here today to tell you that, as we use encryption to improve cybersecurity, we must ensure that we retain society\\'s ability to gain lawful access to data and communications when needed to respond to criminal activity.', 'This proposition should not be controversial. It simply reflects the balance struck in the Constitution itself and maintained since the Founding era.  The Fourth Amendment states:', 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.', 'The Fourth Amendment strikes a balance between the individual citizen\\'s interest in conducting certain affairs in private and the general public\\'s interest in subjecting possible criminal activity to investigation. It does so, on the one hand, by securing for each individual a private enclave around his \"person, house, papers, and effects\" -- a \"zone\" bounded by the individual\\'s own reasonable expectations of privacy. So long as the individual acts within this \"zone of privacy,\" his activities are shielded from unreasonable Government investigation. On the other hand, the Fourth Amendment establishes that, under certain circumstances, the public has a legitimate need to gain access to an individual\\'s zone of privacy in pursuit of public safety, and it defines the terms under which the Government may obtain that access.  When the Government has probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime is within an individual\\'s zone of privacy, the Government is entitled to search for or seize the evidence, and the search usually must be preceded by a judicial determination that \"probable cause\" exists and be authorized by a warrant.', 'The key point is that the individual\\'s right to privacy and the public\\'s right of access are two sides of the same coin.  The reason we are able, as part of our basic social compact, to guarantee individuals a certain zone of privacy is precisely because the public has reserved the right to access that zone when public safety requires.  If the public\\'s right of access is blocked, then these zones of personal privacy are converted into \"law-free zones\" insulated from legitimate scrutiny.', \"Since the Founding, advances in technology have disrupted this balance in different ways.  Sometimes, technology creates new spheres of privacy that the drafters of the Fourth Amendment could not have thought to enumerate, such as with the advent of the telephone.  Sometimes, technology gives law enforcement new means to invade privacy that were previously unimaginable, such as thermal imaging devices.  And sometimes, technology makes it easier for suspects to evade law enforcement even when there is a lawful basis to investigate, such as automobiles -- or to bring us back today's topic, data encryption.\", \"With each of these earlier examples, our society has ensured that the traditional balance between individual privacy and public safety was maintained, as reflected in rulings from the Supreme Court.  In Katz v. United States (1967), the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied to government bugging of a phone booth -- even though this technique did not strictly involve a search of the suspect's person, house, papers, or effects.  Decades later in Kyllo v. United States(2001), the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied to the use of a thermal imaging device to look inside a home -- even though prior doctrine strongly suggested that government exploitation of light waves emitted from the property was outside the scope of Fourth Amendment protection.  The Supreme Court's application of Fourth Amendment protection to the attachment of a GPS tracking device to a car in United States v. Jones (2012) had a similar effect.  In each of these cases, the Court protected privacy against advances in technology.  But of course, law enforcement retained the ability to bug a phone booth, to use thermal imaging on a house, or to attach a GPS device to a car if a warrant issued first.\", 'The same script has played out in reverse, with the Supreme Court taking steps to ensure that advances in technology do not unduly tip the scales against public safety by preventing effective law enforcement.  A notable example concerns automobiles.  If the zone of privacy was extended to automobiles -- as a type of personal \"effect\" or mobile \"house\" -- then it would be difficult, if not impossible, for law enforcement to work within the traditional requirement that police obtain a warrant from a neutral magistrate before conducting a search or seizure.  Even when an officer had probable cause to seize a car and search its contents, the driver could get away long before the officer could complete the process to obtain a warrant.  This development threatened again to disrupt the traditional balance between individual privacy and public safety.', 'So what did we do?  In a series of decisions that started with Carroll v. United States (1925), the Supreme Court articulated an exception to the traditional warrant requirement which allows police to seize and search a car without a warrant so long as it can later be shown that they had probable cause to support the investigation.  In other words, we did not make automobiles law-free zones.  We preserved the constitutional balance by ensuring that law enforcement retained the practical capability to conduct a search when lawfully predicated.', 'The point I hope you take away today is that our societal response to advances in technology that affect the balance between individual privacy and public safety always has been -- and always should be -- a two-way street.  When these advances tip the scales too far in favor of the Government, the response is to expand privacy protections.  And when these advances threaten public safety by thwarting effective law enforcement, the response should be to preserve lawful access. ', \"By enabling dangerous criminals to cloak their communications and activities behind an essentially impenetrable digital shield, the deployment of warrant-proof encryption is already imposing huge costs on society.  It seriously degrades the ability of law enforcement to detect and prevent crime before it occurs. And, after crimes are committed, it thwarts law enforcement's ability to identify those responsible or to successfully prosecute the guilty parties. These costs will grow exponentially as deployment of warrant-proof encryption accelerates and criminals are emboldened by their ability to evade detection.   \", 'At conferences like this, we talk about those costs in abstract terms. They are not abstract; they are real. The costs of irresponsible encryption that blocks legitimate law enforcement access is ultimately measured in a mounting number of victims -- men, women, and children who are the victims of crimes -- crimes that could have been prevented if law enforcement had been given lawful access to encrypted evidence.  Law enforcement has generally not wanted to get too specific about these cases because details can help sophisticated criminals and terrorists evade detection.  But, given the frequency with which these situations are now arising, it is only a matter of time before a sensational case crystalizes the issue for the public.  FBI Director Wray will be speaking later in the week at this Conference and will address some of the damage being inflicted on law enforcement by encryption that blocks lawful access.  But, for now, I want to make a couple of points about the extent of the harm.', 'Like everybody else, criminals of all stripes increasingly rely on wireless communications, hand-held devices, and the internet.  This is especially true of larger-scale criminal organizations that need to coordinate many conspirators over a wide geographical area.  Thus, we have seen transnational drug cartels increasingly move their communications onto commercially available encrypted platforms designed to block lawful access.  One of many examples is a Mexican cartel that recently started trafficking large quantities of finished fentanyl from Asia to Mexico and then to the United States.  The cartel started using WhatsApp as their primary communication method, preventing U.S. law enforcement from conducting wiretaps that would enable us to locate fentanyl shipments and seize them at the border.   We also found that the cartel had used WhatsApp for the specific purpose of coordinating the murders of Mexico-based police officials.  The cartel ended up murdering hundreds of these police officers.  Had we been able to gain lawful access to the chat on a timely basis, we could have saved these lives.  So the costs of not being able to gain lawful access in this case were the lives of the assassinated officers, as well as the many lives impacted here by unimpeded entry into the United States of huge amounts of deadly fentanyl.', 'This is just one of countless examples involving the drug war.  Indeed, just the damage done by warrant-proof encryption to our ability to combat drug trafficking is a cost too high to pay. The tsunami of opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine that started surging into the United States from Mexico in the latter years of the Obama Administration is one of the greatest dangers to the wellbeing of our Nation that we face today. In a single year, more Americans die from drug overdoses than we lost in the entire Vietnam War. In addition to this death toll, hundreds of thousands of lives are destroyed. The vast majority of the drugs are trafficked into the United States by large, transnational criminal organizations.  In times past, when we had considerable success in combating similar cartels, the indispensable tool was communications intelligence.  It remains the indispensable tool today. If our law enforcement agencies do not recover the ability to gain lawful access to encrypted communications and platforms, the prospects of successfully prosecuting the drug war by traditional law enforcement means are dim.', 'Warrant-proof encryption is also seriously impairing our ability to monitor and combat domestic and foreign terrorists.  As with drug cartels, we are seeing terrorist organizations moving their communications to encrypted platforms designed to block lawful access. Even smaller terrorist groups and \"lone wolf\" actors have turned increasingly to encryption.  The 2015 terrorist attack in Garland, Texas still rankles. There, two Islamist extremists carried out an attack for which ISIS claimed responsibility. On the morning of the attack, one of the terrorists exchanged approximately 100 instant messages with an overseas terrorist using an end-to-end encrypted app. To this date, the FBI has still not been able to determine the content of these messages. The deployment of warrant-proof encryption is diminishing the communications intelligence we are able to collect on terrorist threats.  Due to the very nature of terrorism - where each actor seeks to inflict high casualties - encryption that allows terrorists to operate beyond the reach of lawful surveillance poses an unacceptable risk to the country.', 'One further point about the costs imposed on society by warrant-proof encryption: it is not only about the crimes that could have been avoided, or the criminals that escape punishment.  Converting the internet and communication platforms into \"law free\" zones, and thus giving criminals the means to operate free of lawful scrutiny, will inevitably propel an expansion of criminal activity. If you remove any possibility that the cops are going to be watching a neighborhood, the criminals already in the neighborhood will commit a lot more crimes.', 'The \"going dark\" problem is not limited to terrorism or drug cartel cases.  While those cases are vitally important, it is also important that law enforcement at the federal, state, and local level retain the ability to investigate and prosecute the full spectrum of crimes that plague society. We are aware, for example, that a large violent gang is using encrypted apps to \"green light\" assassinations, and yet, because we cannot access the messages, we cannot prevent the murders. We also know that human traffickers and pedophiles use the internet to facilitate their crimes, and yet encryption is impairing our visibility into some of these activities. With the growing availability of commoditized encryption, it is becoming easier for common criminals to communicate beyond the reach of traditional surveillance.  This problem is becoming especially acute for our State and local partners, who lack the resources of the federal government, and whose ability to investigate and prosecute crime is being seriously impaired by warrant-proof encryption.', 'The Department has made clear what we are seeking.  We believe that when technology providers deploy encryption in their products, services, and platforms they need to maintain an appropriate mechanism for lawful access.  This means a way for government entities, when they have appropriate legal authority, to access data securely, promptly, and in an intelligible format, whether it is stored on a device or in transmission.  We do not seek to prescribe any particular solution.  Our private-sector technology providers have immensely talented engineers who have built the very products and services that we are talking about.  They are in the best position to determine what methods of lawful access work best for their technology.  But there have been enough dogmatic pronouncements that lawful access simply cannot be done.  It can be, and it must be.', 'We are confident that there are technical solutions that will allow lawful access to encrypted data and communications by law enforcement without materially weakening the security provided by encryption.  Such encryption regimes already exist.  For example, providers design their products to allow access for software updates using centrally managed security keys. We know of no instance where encryption has been defeated by compromise of those provider-maintained keys. Providers have been able to protect them.', 'We think our tech sector has the ingenuity to develop effective ways to provide secure encryption while also providing secure legal access. Some good minds have already started to focus on this, and some promising ideas are emerging.  Our colleagues from GCHQ have proposed \"Virtual Alligator Clips\" which allow a provider to respond to a warrant by adding a silent law enforcement recipient to an otherwise secure chat.  Ray Ozzie has tabled a proposal for \"Exceptional Access Keys\" for locked, encrypted phones so they can be unlocked pursuant to a warrant.  Matt Tait has proposed Layered Cryptographic Envelopes to allow lawful access to encrypted data-at-rest on disks or other storage devices. I am sure that the putative shortcomings of these ideas have been identified, which hopefully will spur further refinements and alternative proposals.  Through this dialectic we can identify workable solutions. I am not endorsing any particular solution. And we will likely need different kinds of solutions for communications and data in transit, as opposed to data at rest. But I am suggesting that it is well past time for some in the tech community to abandon the indefensible posture that a technical solution is not worth exploring and instead turn their considerable talent and ingenuity to developing products that will reconcile good cybersecurity to the imperative of public safety and national security. As Microsoft\\'s Bill Gates has observed, \"[t]here\\'s no question of ability; it\\'s the question of willingness.\"', 'Some object that requiring providers to design their products to allow for lawful access is incompatible with some companies\\' \"business models.\"  But what is the business objective of the company?  Is it \"A\" -- to sell encryption that provides the best protection against unauthorized intrusion by bad actors?  Or is it \"B\" -- to sell encryption that assures that law enforcement will not be able to gain lawful access?  I hope we can all agree that if the aim is explicitly \"B\" -- that is, if the purpose is to block lawful access by law enforcement, whether or not this is necessary to achieve the best protection against bad actors -- then such a business model, from society\\'s standpoint, is illegitimate, and so is any demand for that product.  The product jeopardizes the public\\'s safety, with no countervailing utility.  Few companies would say this is their goal.', 'On the other hand, it is contended that achieving \"B\" (the blocking of lawful access) is essential to achieving \"A\" (giving the best protection against bad actors). Thus, the argument is that a business is thwarted in its purpose of offering the best protection against bad actors unless it can also override society\\'s interest in retaining lawful access. Some hold this view dogmatically, claiming that it is technologically impossible to provide lawful access without weakening security against unlawful access.  But, in the world of cybersecurity, we do not deal in absolute guarantees but in relative risks. All systems fall short of optimality and have some residual risk of vulnerability -- a point which the tech community acknowledges when they propose that law enforcement can satisfy its requirements by exploiting vulnerabilities in their products.  The real question is whether the residual risk of vulnerability resulting from incorporating a lawful access mechanism is materially greater than those already in the unmodified product.  The Department does not believe this can be demonstrated. ', \"Moreover, even if there was, in theory, a slight risk differential, its significance should not be judged solely by the fact it falls short of theoretical optimality.  Particularly with respect to encryption marketed to consumers, the significance of the risk should be assessed based on its practical effect on consumer cybersecurity, as well as its relation to the net risks that offering the product poses for society.  After all, we are not talking about protecting the Nation's nuclear launch codes. Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, e-mail, and voice and data applications. If one already has an effective level of security -- say, by way of illustration, one that protects against 99 percent of foreseeable threats -- is it reasonable to incur massive further costs to move slightly closer to optimality and attain a 99.5 percent level of protection even where the risk addressed is extremely remote?   A company would not make that expenditure; nor should society.  Here, some argue that, to achieve at best a slight incremental improvement in security, it is worth imposing a massive cost on society in the form of degraded public safety. This is untenable, again using a crude illustration, if the choice is between a world where we can achieve a 99 percent assurance against cyber threats to consumers, while still providing law enforcement 80 percent of the access it might seek; or a world, where we have boosted our cybersecurity to 99.5 percent but at a cost reducing law enforcements access to zero percent -- the choice for society is clear.\", 'Some who resist lawful access complain it places an unreasonable burden on companies, who must spend time and resources on developing and implementing a compliance mechanism.  To that, I first say, \"Welcome to civil society.\"  We regularly expect -- and often mandate if necessary -- that our companies take steps to ensure that their products and services do not impose negative externalities on the public interest.  Sometimes this requires prohibiting certain products all together; other times it requires modification of products so they are compatible with the public interest. ', 'Further, the burden is not as onerous as some make it out to be.  I served for many years as the general counsel of a large telecommunications concern.  During my tenure, we dealt with these issues and lived through the passage and implementation of CALEA -- the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.  CALEA imposes a statutory duty on telecommunications carriers to maintain the capability to provide lawful access to communications over their facilities.  Companies bear the cost of compliance but have some flexibility in how they achieve it, and the system has by and large worked.  It is absurd to think that we would preserve lawful access by mandating that physical telecommunications facilities be accessible to law enforcement for the purpose of obtaining content, while allowing tech providers to block law enforcement from obtaining that very content.', ' The United States is not alone in addressing this issue.  In fact, many of our international partners such as the UK and Australia are already moving on statutory frameworks to address it.  China and Russia have their predictable approach, American companies have an opportunity to advance their interests by setting industry standards now that can influence the conversation here and worldwide in the years to come.', 'Obviously, the Department would like to engage with the private sector in exploring solutions that will provide lawful access.  While we remain open to a cooperative approach, the time to achieve that may be limited. Key countries, including important allies, have been moving toward legislative and regulatory solutions.  I think it is prudent to anticipate that a major incident may well occur at any time that will galvanize public opinion on these issues. Whether we end up with legislation or not, the best course for everyone involved is to work soberly and in good faith together to craft appropriate solutions, rather than have outcomes dictated during a crisis.  As this debate has dragged on, and deployment of warrant-proof encryption has accelerated, our ability to protect the public from criminal threats is rapidly deteriorating.  The status quo is exceptionally dangerous, unacceptable, and only getting worse.  The rest of the world has woken up to this threat.  It is time for the United States to stop debating whether to address it, and start talking about how to address it.']\n"

      "['A criminal complaint was unsealed today charging Park Jin Hyok (bagjinhyeog; a/k/a Jin Hyok Park and Pak Jin Hek), a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in a conspiracy to conduct multiple destructive cyberattacks around the world resulting in damage to massive amounts of computer hardware, and the extensive loss of data, money and other resources (the \"Conspiracy\"). ', 'The complaint alleges that Park was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known to the private sector as the \"Lazarus Group,\" and worked for a North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture (a/k/a Korea Expo Joint Venture or \"KEJV\"), to support the DPRK government\\'s malicious cyber actions. ', \"The Conspiracy's malicious activities include the creation of the malware used in the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 global ransomware attack; the 2016 theft of $81 million from Bangladesh Bank; the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE); and numerous other attacks or intrusions on the entertainment, financial services, defense, technology, and virtual currency industries, academia, and electric utilities. \", \"The charges were announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, First Assistant United States Attorney for the Central District of California Tracy Wilkison and Assistant Director in Charge Paul D. Delacourt of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office.\", \"In addition to these criminal charges, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced today that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Park and KEJV under Executive Order 13722 based on the malicious cyber and cyber-enabled activity outlined in the criminal complaint.\", '\"Today\\'s announcement demonstrates the FBI\\'s unceasing commitment to unmasking and stopping the malicious actors and countries behind the world\\'s cyberattacks,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.  \"We stand with our partners to name the North Korean government as the force behind this destructive global cyber campaign.  This group\\'s actions are particularly egregious as they targeted public and private industries worldwide - stealing millions of dollars, threatening to suppress free speech, and crippling hospital systems.  We\\'ll continue to identify and illuminate those responsible for malicious cyberattacks and intrusions, no matter who or where they are.\"', ' \"The scale and scope of the cyber-crimes alleged by the Complaint is staggering and offensive to all who respect the rule of law and the cyber norms accepted by responsible nations,\" said Assistant Attorney General Demers. \"The Complaint alleges that the North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group, robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations, retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away, and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars\\' worth of damage.  The investigation, prosecution, and other disruption of malicious state-sponsored cyber activity remains among the highest priorities of the National Security Division and I thank the FBI agents, DOJ prosecutors, and international partners who have put years of effort into this investigation.\"', '\"The complaint charges members of this North Korean-based conspiracy with being responsible for cyberattacks that caused unprecedented economic damage and disruption to businesses in the United States and around the globe,\" said First Assistant United States Attorney Tracy Wilkison. \"The scope of this scheme was exposed through the diligent efforts of FBI agents and federal prosecutors who were able to unmask these sophisticated crimes through sophisticated means. They traced the attacks back to the source and mapped their commonalities, including similarities among the various programs used to infect networks across the globe. These charges send a message that we will track down malicious actors no matter how or where they hide. We will continue to pursue justice for those responsible for the huge monetary losses and attempting to compromise the national security of the United States.\"', '\"We will not allow North Korea to undermine global cybersecurity to advance its interests and generate illicit revenues in violation of our sanctions,\" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  \"The United States is committed to holding the regime accountable for its cyber-attacks and other crimes and destabilizing activities.\"', 'Park is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. ', 'About the Defendant Park and Chosun Expo Joint Venture', 'According to the allegations contained in the criminal complaint, which was filed on June 8, 2018 in Los Angeles federal court, and posted today:  Park Jin Hyok, was a computer programmer who worked for over a decade for Chosun Expo Joint Venture (a/k/a Korea Expo Joint Venture or \"KEJV\").  Chosun Expo Joint Venture had offices in China and the DPRK, and is affiliated with Lab 110, a component of DPRK military intelligence.  In addition to the programming done by Park and his group for paying clients around the world, the Conspiracy also engaged in malicious cyber activities.  Security researchers that have independently investigated these activities referred to this hacking team as the \"Lazarus Group.\"  The Conspiracy\\'s methods included spear-phishing campaigns, destructive malware attacks, exfiltration of data, theft of funds from bank accounts, ransomware extortion, and propagating \"worm\" viruses to create botnets.', \"The Conspiracy's Cyber Attacks, Heists, and Intrusions\", \"The complaint describes a broad array of the Conspiracy's alleged malicious cyber activities, both successful and unsuccessful, and in the United States and abroad, with a particular focus on four specific examples. \", 'Targeting the Entertainment Industry', 'In November 2014, the conspirators launched a destructive attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in retaliation for the movie \"The Interview,\" a farcical comedy that depicted the assassination of the DPRK\\'s leader.  The conspirators gained access to SPE\\'s network by sending malware to SPE employees, and then stole confidential data, threatened SPE executives and employees, and damaged thousands of computers.  Around the same time, the group sent spear-phishing messages to other victims in the entertainment industry, including a movie theater chain and a U.K. company that was producing a fictional series involving a British nuclear scientist taken prisoner in DPRK.', 'Targeting Financial Services', 'In February 2016, the Conspiracy stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank.  As part of the cyber-heist, the Conspiracy accessed the bank\\'s computer terminals that interfaced with the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) communication system after compromising the bank\\'s computer network with spear-phishing emails, then sent fraudulently authenticated SWIFT messages directing the Federal Reserve Bank of NY to transfer funds from Bangladesh to accounts in other Asian countries.  The Conspiracy attempted to and did gain access to several other banks in various countries from 2015 through 2018 using similar methods and \"watering hole attacks,\" attempting the theft of at least $1 billion through such operations.', 'Targeting of U.S. Defense Contractors', 'In 2016 and 2017, the Conspiracy targeted a number of U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, with spear-phishing emails. These malicious emails used some of the same aliases and accounts seen in the SPE attack, at times accessed from North Korean IP addresses, and contained malware with the same distinct data table found in the malware used against SPE and certain banks, the complaint alleges. The spear-phishing emails sent to the defense contractors were often sent from email accounts that purported to be from recruiters at competing defense contractors, and some of the malicious messages made reference to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system deployed in South Korea. The attempts to infiltrate the computer systems of Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the THAAD missile system, were not successful.', 'Creation of Wannacry 2.0', \"In May 2017, a ransomware attack known as WannaCry 2.0 infected hundreds of thousands of computers around the world, causing extensive damage, including significantly impacting the United Kingdom's National Health Service.  The Conspiracy is connected to the development of WannaCry 2.0, as well as two prior versions of the ransomware, through similarities in form and function to other malware developed by the hackers, and by spreading versions of the ransomware through the same infrastructure used in other cyber-attacks.\", 'Park and his co-conspirators were linked to these attacks, intrusions, and other malicious cyber-enabled activities through a thorough investigation that identified and traced: email and social media accounts that connect to each other and were used to send spear-phishing messages; aliases, malware \"collector accounts\" used to store stolen credentials; common malware code libraries; proxy services used to mask locations; and North Korean, Chinese, and other IP addresses.  Some of this malicious infrastructure was used across multiple instances of the malicious activities described herein.  Taken together, these connections and signatures--revealed in charts attached to the criminal complaint--show that the attacks and intrusions were perpetrated by the same actors.  ', 'Accompanying Mitigation Efforts', 'Throughout the course of the investigation, the FBI and the Department provided specific information to victims about how they had been targeted or compromised, as well as information about the tactics and techniques used by the conspiracy with the goals of remediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions.  That direct sharing of information took place in the United States and in foreign countries, often with the assistance of foreign law enforcement partners. The FBI also has collaborated with certain private cybersecurity companies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion patterns used by the members of the conspiracy.', 'In connection with the unsealing of the criminal complaint, the FBI and prosecutors provided cybersecurity providers and other private sector partners detailed information on accounts used by the Conspiracy in order to assist these partners in their own independent investigative activities and disruption efforts.', 'The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendant will be determined by the assigned judge.', \"This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Stephanie S. Christensen, Anthony J. Lewis, and Anil J. Antony of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, and DOJ Trial Attorneys David Aaron and Scott Claffee of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.  The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout this investigation, as did many of the FBI's Legal Attaches, and foreign authorities around the world.\", 'The charges contained in the criminal complaint are merely accusations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.', \"For the U.S. Department of Treasury's press release announcing corresponding sanctions please visit www.treasury.gov.\"]\n",

Carlin, U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips of the District of Columbia and Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBI's Washington Field Office.\", \"Eccleston pleaded guilty on Feb. 2, 2016, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to one count of attempted unauthorized access and intentional damage to a protected computer.  In his guilty plea, Eccleston admitted scheming to cause damage to the computer network of the DOE through e-mails that he believed would deliver a computer virus to particular employees.  An e-mail spear-phishing attack involves crafting a convincing e-mail for selected recipients that appears to be from a trusted source and that, when opened, infects the recipient's computer with a virus.   \", 'In addition to the prison time, U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss ordered Eccleston to forfeit $9,000, an amount equal to the sum the FBI provided to Eccleston during the course of the undercover investigation.', '\"Eccleston\\'s sentence holds him accountable for his attempt to compromise, exploit and damage U.S. government computer systems that contained sensitive nuclear weapon-related information with the intent of allowing foreign nations to gain access to that information or to damage essential systems,\" said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.  \"One of our highest priorities in the National Security Division remains protecting our national assets from cyber intrusions.  We must continue to evolve and remain vigilant in our efforts and capabilities to confront cyber-enabled threats and aggressively detect, disrupt and deter them.\"', '\"Charles Harvey Eccleston is a scientist and former government employee who was willing to betray his country and his former employer out of spite,\" said U.S. Attorney Phillips.  \"His attempts to sell access to sensitive computer networks demonstrate why the government must be so vigilant to prevent cyber-attacks. Thanks to the FBI, this defendant was apprehended before he could do any damage. Together with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to make the detection and prevention of cyber-crimes a top priority.\"', '\"Today\\'s sentencing sends a powerful message that no one will be allowed to sabotage the U.S. Government\\'s cyber infrastructure or threaten our national security through the illicit sale of information to a foreign intelligence service,\" said Assistant Director in Charge Abbate.  \"The FBI will continue to investigate and pursue those who attempt to disclose sensitive knowledge about our nation\\'s information systems and bring them to justice.\"', 'Eccleston, a U.S. citizen who had been living in Davao City in the Philippines since 2011, was terminated from his employment at the NRC in 2010.  He was detained by Philippine authorities in Manila, Philippines, on March 27, 2015, and deported to the United States to face U.S. criminal charges.  He has been in custody ever since.', 'According to court documents, Eccleston initially came to the attention of the FBI in 2013 after he entered a foreign embassy in Manila and offered to sell a list of over 5,000 e-mail accounts of all officials, engineers and employees of a U.S. government energy agency.  He said that he was able to retrieve this information because he was an employee of a U.S. government agency, held a top secret security clearance and had access to the agency\\'s network.  He asked for $18,800 for the accounts, stating they were \"top secret.\"  When asked what he would do if that foreign country was not interested in obtaining the U.S. government information the defendant was offering, the defendant stated he would offer the information to China, Iran or Venezuela, as he believed these countries would be interested in the information. ', \"Thereafter, Eccleston met and corresponded with FBI undercover employees who were posing as representatives of the foreign country.  During a meeting on Nov. 7, 2013, he showed one of the undercover employees a list of approximately 5,000 e-mail addresses that he said belonged to NRC employees.  He offered to sell the information for $23,000 and said it could be used to insert a virus onto NRC computers, which could allow the foreign country access to agency information or could be used to otherwise shut down the NRC's servers.  The undercover employee agreed to purchase a thumb drive containing approximately 1,200 e-mail addresses of NRC employees; an analysis later determined that these e-mail addresses were publicly available.  The undercover employee provided Eccleston with $5,000 in exchange for the e-mail addresses and an additional $2,000 for travel expenses.\", 'Over the next several months, Eccleston corresponded regularly by e-mail with the undercover employees.  A follow-up meeting with a second undercover employee took place on June 24, 2014, in which Eccleston was paid $2,000 to cover travel-related expenses.  During this meeting, Eccleston discussed having a list of 30,000 e-mail accounts of DOE employees.  He offered to design and send spear-phishing e-mails that could be used in a cyber-attack to damage the computer systems used by his former employer.', 'Over the next several months, the defendant identified specific conferences related to nuclear energy to use as a lure for the cyber-attack, then drafted emails advertising the conference.  The emails were designed to induce the recipients to click on a link which the defendant believed contained a computer virus that would allow the foreign government to infiltrate or damage the computers of the recipients.  The defendant identified several dozen DOE employees whom he claimed had access to information related to nuclear weapons or nuclear materials as targets for the attack.

Six defendants also face related charges of conspiring to commit interstate and international stalking.  The defendants, allegedly acting at the direction and under the control of PRC government officials, conducted surveillance of and engaged in a campaign to harass, stalk, and coerce certain residents of the United States to return to the PRC as part of a global, concerted, and extralegal repatriation effort known as \"Operation Fox Hunt.\" ', 'Zhu Yong, Hongru Jin, and Michael McMahon were arrested today and will be arraigned this afternoon via teleconference before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo.

Specifically, Rong Jing attempted to hire a private investigator to locate John Doe-1's adult daughter in order to photograph and video record the daughter as part of a campaign to exert pressure on John Doe-1.  Around the same time, an unidentified co-conspirator sent harassing messages over social media to John Doe-1's daughter and her friends related to the PRC's interest in repatriating John Doe-1.\", 'Continued Harassment of Victims', 'In September 2018, Zheng Congying and another unidentified co-conspirator allegedly affixed a threatening note to the door of the John Doe-1\\'s residence stating, \"If you are willing to go back to mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right.  That\\'s the end of this matter!\"  Between February 2019 and April 2019, other co-conspirators caused unsolicited packages to be sent to John Doe-1\\'s residence.

      "[\"Today, the Department of Justice, through the Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) team joined Europol to announce the results of Operation DisrupTor, a coordinated international effort to disrupt opioid trafficking on the Darknet. The operation, which was conducted across the United States and Europe, demonstrates the continued partnership between JCODE and Europol against the illegal sale of drugs and other illicit goods and services.  Operation DisrupTor builds on the success of last year's Operation SaboTor and the coordinated law enforcement takedown of the Wall Street Market, one of the largest illegal online markets on the dark web. \", 'Following the Wall Street Market takedown in May 2019, U.S. and international law enforcement agencies obtained intelligence to identify Darknet drug traffickers, resulting in a series of complementary, but separate, law enforcement investigations. Operation DisrupTor actions have resulted in the arrest of 179 Darknet drug traffickers and fraudulent criminals who engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods and services across the United States and Europe.', 'This operation resulted in the seizure of over $6.5 million in both cash and virtual currencies; approximately 500 kilograms of drugs worldwide; 274 kilograms of drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA, and medicine containing addictive substances in the United States; and 63 firearms. Darknet vendor accounts were identified and attributed to real individuals selling illicit goods on Darknet market sites such as AlphaBay, Dream, WallStreet, Nightmare, Empire, White House, DeepSea, Dark Market and others. By leveraging complementary partnerships and surging resources across the U.S. government and Europol, Operation DisrupTor was used to significantly disrupt the online opioid trade and send a strong message that criminals operating on the Darknet are not beyond the reach of law enforcement. ', 'Operation DisrupTor led to 121 arrests in the United States including two in Canada at the request of the United States, 42 in Germany, eight in the Netherlands, four in the United Kingdom, three in Austria, and one in Sweden. A number of investigations are still ongoing to identify the individuals behind dark web accounts.', '\"Criminals selling fentanyl on the Darknet should pay attention to Operation DisrupTor,\" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.  \"The arrest of 179 of them in seven countries--with the seizure of their drug supplies and their money as well--shows that there will be no safe haven for drug dealing in cyberspace.\"', '\"With the spike in opioid-related overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that today\\'s announcement is important and timely,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.  \"The FBI wants to assure the American public, and the world, that we are committed to identifying Darknet drug dealers and bringing them to justice.  But our work does not end with today\\'s announcement. The FBI, through JCODE and our partnership with Europol, continues to be actively engaged in a combined effort to disrupt the borderless, worldwide trade of illicit drugs. The FBI will continue to use all investigative techniques and tools to identify and prosecute Darknet opioid dealers, wherever they may be located.\"', '\"The 21st century has ushered in a tidal wave of technological advances that have changed the way we live,\" said DEA Acting Administrator Timothy J. Shea.  \"But as technology has evolved, so too have the tactics of drug traffickers.  Riding the wave of technological advances, criminals attempt to further hide their activities within the dark web through virtual private networks and tails, presenting new challenges to law enforcement in the enduring battle against illegal drugs.  Operation DisrupTor demonstrates the ability of DEA and our partners to outpace these digital criminals in this ever-changing domain, by implementing innovative ways to identify traffickers attempting to operate anonymously and disrupt these criminal enterprises.\"', '\"U.S. Immigration and Custom\\'s Enforcement\\'s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has played an integral role in Operation DisrupTor which has effectively removed opioids from our communities,\" said ICE Acting Deputy Director Derek Benner.  \"It has been an honor to work alongside our domestic and international law enforcement partners and pursue bad actors hiding on the Darknet.  Our trained cyber analysts and investigators have conducted undercover efforts that target dark website operators, vendors and prolific buyers of these dangerous drugs. HSI special agents employ unique investigative capabilities to trace and identify the proceeds stemming from the distribution and online sales of fentanyl and other illicit opioids. These efforts will continue to thwart a significant amount of criminal drug sale activity and deter criminals believing they can operate with anonymity on the Darknet.\"', '\"The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has worked diligently for years to rid the mail of illicit drug trafficking and preserve the integrity of the mail,\" said Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale.  \"Most importantly, these efforts provide a safe environment for postal employees and the American public.  Today\\'s announcement serves as an outstanding example of the worldwide impact Postal Inspectors can make through our ever-growing partnerships with federal and international law enforcement agencies.  On behalf of the U.S. Postal Service, we offer our sincere appreciation to all of our partners in this operation who helped protect the nation\\'s mail, and we pledge to never relent in our pursuit of criminals seeking to exploit the U.S. mail.\"', '\"Law enforcement is most effective when working together, and today\\'s announcement sends a strong message to criminals selling or buying illicit goods on the dark web: the hidden internet is no longer hidden, and your anonymous activity is not anonymous,\" said Edvardas Sileris, the Head of Europol\\'s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). \"Law enforcement is committed to tracking down criminals, no matter where they operate - be it on the streets or behind a computer screen.\"', 'The extensive operation, which lasted nine months, resulted in over dozens of federal prosecutions including:', 'An indictment and criminal complaint merely alleges that crimes have been committed. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.', \"Operation DisrupTor was a collaborative initiative across JCODE members, including the Department of Justice; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)'s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and Department of Defense (DOD). Local, state and other federal agencies also contributed to Operation DisrupTor investigations.  The investigations leading to Operation DisrupTor were significantly aided by essential support and coordination by the Department of Justice's multi-agency Special Operations Division, the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, and Organized Crime and Gang Section, the Justice Department's Office of International Affairs, the National Cyber Joint Investigative Task Force (NCJITF), Europol and its Dark Web team and international partners Eurojust, Austrian Federal Investigation Bureau (Bundeskriminalamt), Cyprus Police (Astunomia Kuprou), German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Portuguese Judicial Police (Policia Judiciaria), Dutch Police (Politie), Swedish Police (Polisen), the British National Crime Agency, Australia's Western Australia Police Force and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.\", 'Federal prosecutions are being conducted in more than 20 Federal districts, including: the Central District of California, the Eastern District of California, the Northern District of California, the Southern District of California, the District of Colorado, the District of Columbia, the District of Connecticut, the Middle District of Florida, the Southern District of Florida, the Northern District of Georgia, the District of Hawaii, the Western District of Missouri, the District of New Jersey, the Western District of North Carolina, the Northern District of Ohio, the Southern District of Ohio, District of Oregon, the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Northern District of Texas, the Eastern District of Virginia, the District of the Virgin Islands and the Western District of Washington.', 'JCODE is an FBI-led Department of Justice initiative, which works closely with the DEA-led, multi-agency, Special Operations Division to support, coordinate and de-conflict investigations targeting for disruption and dismantlement of the online sale of illegal drugs, especially fentanyl and other opioids. Additionally, JCODE targets the trafficking of weapons and other illicit goods and services on the internet. Operation DisrupTor illustrates the investigative power of federal and international partnerships to combat the borderless nature of online criminal activity.', 'Documents related to this announcement can be viewed here.', 'The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

Angwang was arrested earlier today in Williston Park, New York, and his initial appearance is scheduled for this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo at the United States Courthouse in Brooklyn, New York.\", '\"State and local officials should be aware that they are not immune to the threat of Chinese espionage,\" said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.  \"According to the allegations, the Chinese government recruited and directed a U.S. citizen and member of our nation\\'s largest law enforcement department to further its intelligence gathering and repression of Chinese abroad.  Our police departments provide for our public safety and are often the first line of defense against the national security threats our country faces.  We will continue to work with our state and local partners to protect our nation\\'s great police departments.\"', '\"The defendant is charged with violating his sworn oath as a New York City police officer to protect and serve the citizens of New York by instead reporting to PRC government officials about the activities of Chinese citizens in the New York area and developing intelligence sources within the Tibetan community in the United States,\" stated Acting United States Attorney Seth D. DuCharme.  \"Today\\'s arrest shows that no one - especially one sworn to uphold the law - is immune from prosecution for illegal acts on behalf of foreign governments.\"', '\"The defendant allegedly violated the trust of his community and the New York City Police Department on behalf of a foreign power, the People\\'s Republic of China.  This type of conduct simply cannot be tolerated,\" said Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI\\'s Counterintelligence Division.  \"This case serves as yet another reminder that China represents the biggest counterintelligence threat to the United States and that the FBI and our partners will be aggressive in investigating and stopping such activities within our nation.\"', '\"This is the definition of an insider threat - as alleged, Angwang operated on behalf of a foreign government; lied to gain his clearance, and used his position as an NYPD police officer to aid the Chinese government\\'s subversive and illegal attempts to recruit intelligence sources,\" stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office William F. Sweeney.  \"The FBI is committed to stopping hostile foreign governments from infiltrating our institutions, and we will we not tolerate the behavior of those who willingly violate their oath to the United States, and covertly work against their fellow citizens. We want to thank the NYPD for its extraordinary partnership on this investigation.\"', '\"As alleged in this federal complaint, Baimadajie Angwang violated every oath he took in this country. One to the United States, another to the U.S. Army, and a third to this Police Department,\" stated NYPD Commissioner Dermot F. Shea.  \"From the earliest stages of this investigation, the NYPD\\'s Intelligence and Internal Affairs bureaus worked closely with the FBI\\'s Counterintelligence Division to make sure this individual would be brought to justice.\"', \"According to the publicly filed complaint and detention memorandum, Angwang, an ethnic Tibetan native of the PRC and naturalized U.S. citizen who resides in Williston Park, New York, is assigned to NYPD's community affairs unit where, among other things, he serves as a liaison to the community served by the 111th Precinct. \", 'Since at least 2014, Angwang acted at the direction and control of officials at the PRC Consulate in New York City.  Specifically, Angwang reported on the activities of Chinese citizens in the New York area, spotted and assessed potential intelligence sources within the Tibetan community in New York and elsewhere, and provided PRC officials with access to senior NYPD officials through invitations to official events.  One of the PRC Consular officials at whose direction Angwang acted worked for the \"China Association for Preservation and Development of Tibetan Culture,\" a division of the PRC\\'s United Front Work Department.  This Department is responsible for, among other things, neutralizing potential opponents of the PRC and co-opting ethnic Chinese individuals living outside the PRC.', 'According to court documents, Angwang was explicit about his motivations, telling his PRC official handler that was wanted to get promoted within the NYPD so that he could assist the PRC and bring \"glory to China.\"  In addition, Angwang told his handler that the handler\\'s superiors in Beijing \"should be happy . . . because you have stretched your reach into the police.\"', 'In addition to acting as an illegal agent of the PRC, Angwang is also charged with committing wire fraud, making material false statements and obstructing an official proceeding.  As part of his employment with the U.S. Army Reserve, Angwang maintained a \"SECRET\"-level security clearance.  According to court documents, in 2019, Angwang completed and electronically submitted an SF-86C form for a background investigation.  On the form, Angwang lied by denying that he had contacts with a foreign government or its consulate and by denying that he had close and continuing contacts with foreign nationals, including his family members who live in the PRC, some of whom were affiliated with the People\\'s Liberation Army.   ', \"The charges in the complaint are merely allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Shahnaz also fraudulently obtained more than a dozen credit cards and used them to purchase approximately $62,000 in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies online.  Shahnaz then made multiple wire transfers totaling more than $150,000 to individuals and entities in Pakistan, China and Turkey that were fronts for ISIS.', \"Shahnaz accessed ISIS violent jihad-related websites and message boards, and social media and messaging pages of known ISIS recruiters, facilitators and financiers.  She also performed numerous internet searches for information that would facilitate her entry into Syria.  Court-authorized search warrants executed at Shahnaz's residence on Long Island resulted in the seizure of terrorist and jihad-related propaganda, including a photograph of a suicide belt of explosives and a night vision scope. \", 'On July 31, 2017, Shahnaz was arrested at John F.

Lin, a former manager with an international air carrier headquartered in the PRC (the Air Carrier), abused her privileges to transport packages from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK Airport) to the PRC aboard Air Carrier flights at the behest of the PRC military officers and in violation of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) regulations.  The proceeding was held before United States District Judge Ann M. Donnelly.\", \"Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney Richard P.

Melendez, Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) announced the guilty plea.\", '\"This case is a stark example of the Chinese government using the employees of Chinese companies doing business here to engage in illegal activity,\" said Assistant Attorney General Demers.  \"Covertly doing the Chinese military\\'s bidding on U.S. soil is a crime, and Lin and the Chinese military took advantage of a commercial enterprise to evade legitimate U.S. government oversight.\"', '\"The defendant\\'s actions as an agent of the Chinese government helped Chinese military officers to evade U.S. law enforcement scrutiny of packages that they sent from New York to Beijing,\" stated United States Attorney Donoghue.  \"This case demonstrates how seriously we address counterintelligence threats posed by individuals in the United States who work for foreign governments, such as China.\" ', '\"The FBI and our law enforcement partners do all we can every day to protect this country from the threats we can see, and we work even harder to find the threats we can\\'t see,\" said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney.  \"Ms. Lin was secreting packages through some of the country\\'s busiest airports, using her work with the Chinese government to thwart our security measures.  We believe this case isn\\'t unique and hope it serves as an example that the Chinese and other foreign governments can\\'t break our laws with impunity.\"', '\"Lin\\'s criminal actions exploited the international boundary of the United States as she used her position to smuggle packages onto planes headed to China,\" said HSI Special Agent-in-Charge Melendez. \"We are committed to ensuring the integrity of our international airports so they are not used as a front for illicit activities.\"', \"Lin worked for the Air Carrier from 2002 through the fall of 2015 as a counter agent at JFK Airport and from the fall of 2015 through April 2016 as the station manager at Newark Liberty International Airport.  During her employment with the Air Carrier, Lin accepted packages from the PRC military officers, and placed those packages aboard Air Carrier flights to the PRC as unaccompanied luggage or checked in the packages under the names of other passengers flying on those flights.  As the PRC military officers did not travel on those flights, Lin's actions were contrary to a security program that required that checked baggage be accepted only from ticketed passengers, thereby violating TSA regulations.  In addition, Lin encouraged other Air Carrier employees to assist the PRC military officers, instructing those employees that because the Air Carrier was a PRC company, their primary loyalty should be to the PRC.\", \"In exchange for her work at the direction and under the control of PRC military officers and other PRC government officials, Lin received benefits from the PRC Mission and PRC Consulate in New York.

      "['Good afternoon. I am grateful to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for hosting this discussion about the rule of law.', 'A prosperous and safe society needs to vest people with the power to govern - the ability to set enforceable rules, punish violations, and act on behalf of the people.  The question is how the governing power shall be exercised.  One of our nation\\'s founders, John Adams, advocated \"a government of laws, not of men.\"  The goal is for the people who exercise government power to act in accordance with neutral principles and fair processes, while respecting individual rights.', 'The idea dates at least to the fourth century BC, when Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote, \"It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens.\"', 'Last year, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation explaining that \"we govern ourselves in accordance with the rule of law rather [than] ... the whims of an elite few or the dictates of collective will.  Through law, we have ensured liberty.\"', \"As the President recognized, law provides the framework for freedom.  At its best, law reflects moral choices; principled decisions that promote society's best interests and protect citizens' fundamental rights.\", 'John MacArthur Maguire described law as a system of \"wise restraints that make men free.\"  The restraints preserve liberty because they are prescribed in advance, and they apply to everyone, without regard to rank or status.', 'The rule of law is indispensable to a thriving and vibrant society.  It protects people from arbitrary government action.  It allows businesses to enter into contracts.  It gives innovators protection for their discoveries.  It keeps people safe from dangerous criminals.  And it allows us to resolve differences peacefully through reason and logic.', 'Justice Anthony Kennedy explained it this way: in a rule of law system, when you apply to a government clerk for a permit and you satisfy the criteria, you are not asking for a favor. You have a right to the permit, and the clerk has a duty to give it to you.  In many countries, that concept of government officials legally required to serve the people does not exist.', 'A society can easily achieve the appearance of the rule of law without accomplishing it in fact. In Shakespeare\\'s play Henry the Fourth, a prince brags about his connections to the devil. He proudly claims: \"I can summon spirits from the vasty deep.\" His skeptical friend mockingly replies, \"Why, so can I.... But [the question is,] will they come when you ... call for them?\"', 'An agreed-upon set of rules is necessary for a system that operates under the rule of law, but it is not a sufficient condition.  The rule of law is not just about written precepts.  It depends on the vigilance and character of individual men and women who faithfully implement it.  The enforcement mechanism is crucial, as James Madison recognized in Federalist 51, because \"you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\"', 'The founders of our nation well understood the challenge.  First, they fought a war on their own soil to break free from rule by a foreign monarch.  Then they operated for a decade under the Articles of Confederation, with a weak central government that proved incapable of meeting its obligations.', 'So, in 1787, the Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia to establish foundational rules for a new central government.', \"The founders agreed on a written Constitution establishing a system that divides the government's power among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.  The system protects against the concentration of power by allowing each branch to check and balance the others.\", 'When Benjamin Franklin was walking home from the Convention, a woman named Elizabeth Powel asked him what type of government the Founders created.  Franklin replied with these words: \"A republic, ... if you can keep it.\" ', \"Some people think that politicians are responsible for keeping the republic.  But Franklin spoke to an ordinary citizen - a woman who did not even have the right to vote.  The lesson is that a constitutional republic's success depends on people conscientiously applying the rules.\", 'One indicator that we are faithfully enforcing the law is when we accept that it requires an outcome we dislike.  We respect the result because it is the result of a fair process - an objective analysis of the facts and a rational application of the predetermined rules.', 'An independent judiciary is a central pillar of our system. Our federal judges, by design, do not defer to popular will.  They do not run for election.  They do not answer to the executive branch.  Nor are they beholden to the legislature.  Their duty is to say what the law is, independently and impartially.  They take an oath to \"administer justice without respect to persons,\" and to \"impartially ... perform\" their duties.', 'The judicial branch is independent because we accept its final rulings, even when we disagree with them.  The judiciary serves as a check on the other branches, not a subordinate.', 'American institutions and the people who compose them sometimes fall short of our ideals.  No system is infallible.  But at its core, our society fundamentally respects the rule of law, by which we mean a system that is just and protective of human freedoms.', 'Not all nations share that concept.  As we seek to build bridges with foreign adversaries, it is important for us to understand the different visions that underlay their legal systems.', 'In China, for example, the Supreme Court urged government officials to actively resist \"Western-style\" \"judicial independence,\" deriding it as \"erroneous\" and \"mistaken.\"  The Chinese Communist Party sits above the government. In January, a party directive instructed the country\\'s courts to protect the Party\\'s \"political security.\"  Instead of maintaining independence from the executive branch, the Chinese judiciary\\'s duty is to further Communist Party goals.  The party controls the appointment of all judges and even dictates some of their rulings.', 'Daily practice in the courts is also a study in contrasts.  In our courts, the presumption of innocence is perhaps the most important safeguard of individual liberty.  When our government makes an allegation of wrongdoing, we need to prove it.  We must present evidence that satisfies the rules governing admissibility.  We need to call witnesses who remain credible when subjected to vigorous cross-examination.  The defendant gets an opportunity to present his own evidence and witnesses.  And the presumption of innocence is overcome only if we prove our case to the unanimous satisfaction of the judge and a jury of 12 random citizens.  If even one juror is unconvinced, the defendant prevails.  Government officials may sincerely believe that a defendant is guilty, but their belief is irrelevant.  Investigators and prosecutors do not get to decree which facts are true.', \"In contrast, the Chinese system effectively presumes guilt when a defendant stands charged with a crime.  Moreover, the presumption is all but irrebuttable.  Chinese judges receive the government's evidence before trial, without any opportunity for comment or cross-examination by the defense.  Live testimony is offered only rarely.  There is little to no opportunity to impeach witnesses.  Prosecutors rarely lose a case.\", 'There are substantial differences in our criminal arrest and detention practices, too.  In the United States, a criminal defendant arrested by the police without a warrant has the right to appear before a neutral judge within 48 hours.  If the police satisfy the judge through a sworn allegation of guilt and obtain a warrant before making an arrest, the defendant still has the right to review by a judge without \"unnecessary delay.\"  A criminal defendant may be detained in the United States only with a judicial finding that there is probable cause to believe that he committed a crime.  In addition, federal law still requires release before trial unless the judge finds clear and convincing evidence that the defendant would pose a risk of flight or a danger to the community.', 'In China, forms of extrajudicial pretrial detention are enshrined in law.  Last September, the former President of INTERPOL, Meng Hongwei, was forcibly detained by his own government, without explanation.  Meng has been reportedly detained under a new form of custody called liuzhi or \"retention in custody.\"  Under liuzhi, a suspect is held incommunicado at an undisclosed location and denied access to legal counsel and family for as long as six months without charges.  ', 'In Xinjiang province, Chinese law allows the extrajudicial mass detention of citizens who are ethnic Uighurs, a minority population native to the province.  Today, more than one million Uighurs and other minorities reportedly are detained in internment camps.  They are forced to renounce their culture and religion, and they face political \"reeducation.\"  The province\\'s law authorizes the arrest of anyone for violations that include expressing an allegiance to Uighur culture and reading prohibited religious books.  Many people have been arrested and detained for long periods of time, without charge, trial, or due process.', 'Citizens of countries that operate in that way are subject to \"rule through law.\"  The law does not charge anyone with serving as an independent guarantor of liberties or a check on political influence, as in the American system.  Instead, the law is an instrument of state power, a mechanism for rulers to maintain control and quash dissent.  In the absence of a culture that respects the rule of law, written protections are routinely violated or selectively enforced, and victims are bereft of any legal remedy.', 'In those nations, law may be used instrumentally as either a weapon or a shield -- not merely against their domestic populations, but also beyond of their borders.  They direct their transactional approach to the law outward, with damaging and far-reaching effects.', 'China, for instance, appears to detain foreign citizens as a means of retaliating or inflicting political pressure on other countries.  In 2014, Canadian authorities arrested a Chinese national named Su Bin at the request of the United States.  We sought his extradition for hacking-related offenses and the theft of sensitive military and export-controlled data that was sent to China.', 'In an apparent act of reprisal, Chinese authorities apprehended a Canadian couple who had lived in China for 30 years without incident.  They were accused of spying and threatened with execution.  The wife was detained for six months before being released on conditions. The husband did not meet with a lawyer for almost a year.  He was held for more than two years.', 'Meanwhile, Su Bin consented to his transport to the United States, retained a lawyer of his choice, and received all the protections afforded a criminal defendant in our system.', 'In some cases, China, Russia, and other authoritarian nations overtly shield their nationals from the fair administration of justice. On numerous occasions they refuse to provide mutual legal assistance in response to justified requests by the United States and other countries for evidence for criminal investigations and prosecutions.', 'As transnational crime increases in scope and complexity, we increasingly face cross-border criminal investigations with defendants, evidence, and witnesses that span the globe. Countries depend heavily on expeditious international cooperation to build cases and to locate, arrest, and extradite fugitives to hold them to account for their crimes.  Providing safe havens for criminals is inconsistent with the rule of law.', 'Some countries also undermine the law by using extralegal means to forcibly repatriate fugitives.  China sends agents known as \"Fox Hunt\" teams to the United States and elsewhere to track down Chinese nationals accused of political or corruption crimes.  The squads enter foreign countries under false pretenses, track down fugitives and deploy intimidation tactics to force them to return to China.', 'Inside China, government officials possess authority to impose \"exit bans,\" prohibiting some foreigners from leaving the country, without judicial process.  They sometimes use bans as a form of coercion, to compel a victim\\'s relative or friend suspected of wrongdoing to return to China.  One American teenager, a college sophomore, is now trapped in China, being used as a hostage by authorities hoping to coerce his father to return.  China\\'s abuse of foreign visitors as political pawns caused the State Department to issue a travel advisory last month.', 'In the United States, we strive to faithfully and responsibly discharge our responsibilities to assist foreign law enforcement, providing due process, holding criminals accountable, and respecting individual rights.', \"When Chinese citizens who commit crimes in other countries remain in China, China neither extradites them nor consistently prosecutes them for offenses against foreign victims.  In contrast, the United States extradites citizens, as well as foreign nationals, when the law warrants it.  Over the past five years, the United States extradited 95 Americans.  We also cooperate with other countries' requests for mutual legal assistance and extradition in their investigations and prosecutions.  We do so based on a fair-minded assessment of the evidence, without consideration of nationality.  Last year, for instance, the United States removed Xu Chaofan, a Chinese fugitive who allegedly embezzled $485 million from the Bank of China.\", 'Combating transnational crime requires foreign partners to act reciprocally, transparently, and in good faith.  When a fair-minded assessment of the evidence establishes significant crimes, nations should not shield citizens from the fair administration of justice, or otherwise subvert legal processes.', 'Some countries also seek to advance their ends by changing global criminal justice norms.  For instance, Russia and China seek to replace the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. That Convention is approved by the United States and more than 60 other nations.  It harmonizes national interests and enhances the flow of electronic evidence among nations to facilitate the investigation of cybercrimes -- while balancing civil liberties and privacy interests.', 'Russia rejects the Budapest Convention, complaining that the pact allows individual owners of data to control it.  In its place, Russia seeks to advance a new convention that would enhance the ability of regimes to control communication, limit information-sharing between nations, and impede efforts to investigate cybercrime.  We reject the effort to undermine the goal of an open Internet governed by the rule of law and protected by international cooperation.', 'I want to emphasize that the people of China, Russia, and other nations that do not share our respect for individual rights are not our enemies.  It is good for us to seek common ground with their leaders.  President Trump describes our relationship as \"a new era of competition.\"  He extends an open hand to \"rival powers ... that seek to challenge American influence, values, and wealth.  We will attempt to build a great partnership with those and other countries, but in a manner that always protects our national interest.\"', 'The rule of law is central to our national interest.  While we cannot expect any system to be flawless in operation, the key issue is whether the government establishes fair rules, respects individual rights, and punishes violations.  Consider the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  There may be factual disputes about who is responsible for an extrajudicial killing, but our allies must agree on the principle that each culpable person should be held accountable, because a government that operates under the rule of law cannot condone the cold-blooded murder of non-violent dissidents.', 'Let me conclude with this observation.  I am proud to serve in the Department of Justice with 115,000 colleagues who promote the rule of law, a goal held jointly with state and local law enforcement officers.  We share a noble calling to pursue justice, a calling enforced by the additional safeguard of an independent judiciary.', 'We work regularly with law enforcement partners in China, Russia, and other rival nations to advance our interests, but always with a clear-eyed understanding of our responsibility to serve as vigilant custodians of the rule of law.  Our Constitution aspires to \"secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\"  In order to sustain it in an interconnected world, we should defend, cherish, and champion neutral legal principles and processes -- in practice and not just on paper.']\n",

They are helping us uphold the rule of law with integrity.\"', '\"As charged in the indictment, Huawei and its Chief Financial Officer broke U.S. law and have engaged in a fraudulent financial scheme that is detrimental to the security of the United States,\" said Secretary Nielsen.  \"They willfully conducted millions of dollars in transactions that were in direct violation of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, and such behavior will not be tolerated.

I would like to thank ICE Homeland Security Investigations for their exceptional work on this case.\"', '\"For years, Chinese firms have broken our export laws and undermined sanctions, often using U.S. financial systems to facilitate their illegal activities,\" said Secretary Ross. \"This will end.  The Trump Administration continues to be tougher on those who violate our export control laws than any administration in history.  I commend the Commerce Department\\'s Office of Export Enforcement, and our partners in the FBI, Justice Department, Department of Defense, and Department of Homeland Security for their excellent work on this case.\"', '\"As charged in the indictment, Huawei and its subsidiaries, with the direct and personal involvement of their executives, engaged in serious fraudulent conduct, including conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud, sanctions violations, money laundering and the orchestrated obstruction of justice,\" stated U.S. Attorney Donoghue.  \"For over a decade, Huawei employed a strategy of lies and deceit to conduct and grow its business.  This Office will continue to hold accountable companies and their executives, whether here or abroad, that commit fraud against U.S. financial institutions and their international counterparts and violate U.S. laws designed to maintain our national security.\"  Mr. Donoghue thanked the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\\'s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) agents who are investigating this case for their tireless work and dedication.', '\"These charges lay bare Huawei\\'s alleged blatant disregard for the laws of our country and standard global business practices,\" said FBI Director Wray.  \"Companies like Huawei pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security, and the magnitude of these charges make clear just how seriously the FBI takes this threat.  Today should serve as a warning that we will not tolerate businesses that violate our laws, obstruct justice, or jeopardize national and economic well-being.\"', '* * * *', 'Overview of the Indictment', \"The charges in this case relate to a long-running scheme by Huawei, its CFO, and other employees to deceive numerous global financial institutions and the U.S. government regarding Huawei's business activities in Iran.  As alleged in the indictment, beginning in 2007, Huawei employees lied about Huawei's relationship to a company in Iran called Skycom, falsely asserting it was not an affiliate of Huawei.  The company further claimed that Huawei had only limited operations in Iran and that Huawei did not violate U.S. or other laws or regulations related to Iran.  Most significantly, after news publications in late 2012 and 2013 disclosed that Huawei operated Skycom as an unofficial affiliate in Iran and that Meng had served on the board of directors of Skycom, Huawei employees, and in particular Meng, continued to lie to Huawei's banking partners about Huawei's relationship with Skycom.  They falsely claimed that Huawei had sold its interest in Skycom to an unrelated third party in 2007 and that Skycom was merely Huawei's local business partner in Iran.  In reality, Skycom was Huawei's longstanding Iranian affiliate, and Huawei orchestrated the 2007 sale to appear as an arm's length transaction between two unrelated parties, when in fact Huawei actually controlled the company that purchased Skycom. \", \"As part of this scheme to defraud, Meng allegedly personally made a presentation in August 2013 to an executive of one of Huawei's major banking partners in which she repeatedly lied about the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. \", 'According to the indictment, Huawei relied on its global banking relationships for banking services that included processing U.S.-dollar transactions through the United States.  U.S. laws and regulations generally prohibited these banks from processing transactions related to Iran through the United States.  The banks could have faced civil or criminal penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. laws or regulations.  Relying on the repeated misrepresentations by Huawei, these banks continued their banking relationships with Huawei.  One bank cleared more than $100 million worth of Skycom-related transactions through the United States between 2010 and 2014.', \"In furtherance of this scheme to defraud, and as alleged in the indictment, Huawei and its principals repeatedly lied to U.S. government authorities about Huawei's business in Iran in submissions to the U.S. government, and in responses to government inquiries.  For example, Huawei provided false information to the U.S. Congress regarding whether Huawei's business in Iran violated any U.S. law.  Similarly, as indicated in the indictment, in 2007 -- months before Huawei orchestrated the purported sale of Skycom to another Huawei-controlled entity -- Huawei's founder falsely stated to FBI agents that Huawei did not have any direct dealings with Iranian companies and that Huawei operated in compliance with all U.S. export laws. \", \"After one of Huawei's major global banking partners (identified as Financial Institution 1 in the indictment) decided to exit the Huawei relationship in 2017 because of Huawei's risk profile, Huawei allegedly made additional misrepresentations to several of its remaining banking partners in an effort to maintain and expand those relationships.  Huawei and its principals are alleged to have repeatedly and falsely claimed that Huawei had decided to terminate its banking relationship with Financial Institution 1, when in fact it was Financial Institution 1 that had decided to terminate the banking relationship.  Through these misrepresentations, Huawei was able to continue its banking relationships with its other banks.\", \"In 2017, when Huawei became aware of the government's investigation, Huawei and its subsidiary Huawei USA allegedly tried to obstruct the investigation by making efforts to move witnesses with knowledge about Huawei's Iran-based business to the PRC, and beyond the jurisdiction of the U.S. government, and by concealing and destroying evidence of Huawei's Iran-based business that was located in the United States.\", \"In December 2018, Canadian authorities apprehended Meng in Vancouver pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant issued under Canadian law.  The U.S. government is seeking Meng's extradition to the United States.\", 'The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.', 'The indictment unsealed today is assigned to U.S. District Judge Ann M.

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery', '\\nLaw enforcement agencies increasingly rely on electronic evidence to investigate and prosecute crimes.  Thus, in our digital age, it is paramount that investigators maintain effective, efficient, and lawful access to electronic data.  That is especially the case as businesses store information across the globe in an effort to reach new markets, better serve their customers, and streamline their operations.', 'Every government confronts the challenge of accessing data across borders for law enforcement purposes.  I would like to speak to you today about the solution that my government has chosen.  It is a solution rooted in a broader vision of the Internet that is open, interoperable, and governed by the rule of law.  It is a solution that protects individual privacy and respects the legal regimes of other democratic nations.  And it is a solution that rejects one worldview that protects criminals by elevating privacy above every other value, just as it rejects another, equally dangerous worldview that would accept the jurisdictional claims of any foreign government, no matter how authoritarian it might be.', 'We stand at a pivotal moment in the future of cross-border data flows.  The decisions we make today will have extraordinary consequences for public safety, commercial innovation, and individual freedom.  I appreciate your willingness to listen to the solution my government has chosen to address these challenges.  Hopefully, you will find that vision as appealing as we do.', 'Our lives increasingly rely on a growing digital infrastructure.  This technological progress has brought with it profound change--much of it positive, and on an unprecedented scale.  The services and networks we depend on literally span the globe, along with the data centers that host our communications and the devices that route them to their destinations in an instant.  As a result, more entities handle more data in more places than was possible ever before.', 'These developments carry significant implications for individual privacy.  As societies, we are rightly concerned with understanding and managing those implications.  At the same time, privacy regimes should not impair the lawful and effective exercise of critical governmental functions.', \"When it comes to protecting the privacy of data, we in the United States engage in risk management.  Our elected legislatures determine which risks to private information are greatest, and the laws they enact reflect those commitments.  As a result, we have strong statutory privacy and security protections in particular areas such as healthcare, financial information, and employment, as well as for communications data.  We also have strong constitutional limitations on our government's authority to access data in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.  By keeping communications open with the business community, the United States--while certainly not perfect--has nonetheless achieved some of the highest data security and privacy compliance rates in the world, while still maintaining a healthy, dynamic economy.\", \"Tomorrow, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, goes into effect.  The GDPR reflects a different approach to data protection.  Based on the premise that data protection is a fundamental human right, the GDPR defines personal information extremely broadly, announces a system of universal rules that apply irrespective of context, and imposes huge penalties for non-compliance.\", 'The American approach to privacy and data security is different from that of Europe.  At the same time, we share with Europe a culture that deeply values respect for personal privacy and individual autonomy, as embodied in our Constitution and laws.  The perception that Americans do not care about privacy as much as Europeans do, or that US law does not adequately protect privacy, is unfair.  This misperception may have contributed to a series of European enforcement actions against US companies.  It sometimes seems that, in the European mind, the American tradition of strong privacy norms and enforcement is ignored, while transfers of personal data to countries that treat the values of personal privacy and individual autonomy with contempt, trigger little comparable scrutiny.', 'The problem isn\\'t simply one of selective enforcement.  The deeper issue is the risk that those charged with implementing the GDPR may attempt to regulate user privacy without fully weighing the potential costs to public safety.  To be clear, there is no reason why the GDPR, as currently drafted, should affect information sharing between law enforcement agencies.  The European Union and the United States already have entered into a binding international agreement governing privacy protections for such information sharing.  With respect to the sharing of EU person information by the private sector, the United States has entered into two binding international agreements governing the protection of particular types of transfers with US law enforcement.  And while the GDPR\\'s Article 48 places a preference on the treaty channel for data transfers to non-EU nations, that channel is \"without prejudice to other grounds for transfer,\" including pursuant to an \"adequacy decision\" or a finding that the other country sufficiently protects personal data.  If necessary, the United States is also well-positioned for a different agreement to cover future transfers, given our strong privacy protections in the area of law enforcement.  Finally, even absent blanket solutions, the GDPR authorizes transfers \"necessary for important reasons of public interest,\" including the need to combat serious cross-border crimes.', \"But even if the GDPR doesn't pose a direct obstacle to cross-border law enforcement data sharing, the European model of data protection nonetheless sometimes threatens to significantly restrict government efforts to protect public safety and national security, as we have seen in litigation over areas as diverse as data retention and passenger name records.  The non-territoriality of electronic data exacerbates these effects.  Because of the Internet's borderless nature, EU restrictions imposed in the name of privacy inevitably extend far beyond the EU's borders, and, in effect, regulate even the core public safety missions of other rights-respecting countries.\", \"Let me give you a concrete example.  Since the 1980s, persons who registered Internet domain names have accepted that doing so carries with it the obligation of making public certain limited contact information.  A non-profit entity, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, manages that information, and maintains it in an online database called WHOIS.  The WHOIS database greatly assists investigators because determining who controls a domain can be important to making contact if the domain is being used to cause harm, such as hosting child exploitation materials or serving as part of a botnet's command and control function.  American law enforcement agencies query WHOIS data tens of thousands of times a day, not only to investigate crimes, but also to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.  Investigators also rely on WHOIS to combat fraud and deceptive practices.\", \"Despite the WHOIS database's obvious role in maintaining public safety around the world--including in Europe--the Dutch data protection authority has declared that the database is in direct violation of GDPR.  So far as we know, much of this critical source of information will be limited, if not completely blocked, for many non-law enforcement agencies starting tomorrow.  As for law enforcement personnel: starting May 25, they will have to find ways to ensure they retain access to the database, and to authenticate their identities.  The long and short of the extensive effort to make WHOIS GDPR-compliant is this: if European data protection authorities interpret the GDPR such that public access to the WHOIS database is restricted or eliminated, public safety will suffer--including in Europe.\", 'It is not just WHOIS data that is at stake.  The evidence we need to identify all kinds of criminals and bring them to justice frequently takes the form of electronic communications data, and it often resides on the very same systems these individuals use to commit their criminal acts. ', 'That is why, if you ask any law enforcement officer with cyber experience, he or she will tell you that virtually every serious crime we investigate--from violent crime, to narcotics trafficking, to fraud, in addition to cybercrime and terrorism--requires effective and efficient access to electronic evidence.  To protect society against modern threats, investigators need evidence like the contents of emails, instant messages, and photos; they need traffic data and session logs; and they need subscriber information.  Yet, as a result of GDPR and of another draft EU law, the proposed e-Privacy Regulation--which in Article 7  would require providers, including non-EU based providers offering services in Europe,  to destroy or to anonymize metadata and content information that may be evidence of crime, once that information is no longer needed for purposes of transmitting a communication--law enforcement agencies worldwide may now find themselves blocked from obtaining this vital evidence in a timely manner, or even at all.  And while these regulations do allow EU Member States to legislate exemptions from these rules, they do not extend this privilege to countries outside of the EU.', 'These kinds of legal barriers dangerously impede our efforts--and those of our allies--to investigate serious crime and terrorism.', \"If the European model, which privileges privacy above other values (and often to the detriment of public safety) represents one worldview regarding cross-border data flows, the worldview espoused by nations like Russia and China represents another.  That worldview rejects outright the very concept of the free flow of information.  Instead, it focuses on citizenship, territoriality, and control, insisting--in its most extreme form--that basically every piece of information relating to a nation's citizens must be housed in its own borders, and must be accessible to the government without basic privacy protections.\", '\"Data localization\" laws of this sort are costly for companies.  Isolating all of the information that pertains to a particular nation\\'s citizens within that nation\\'s borders also can impede the free flow of data and ideas, and inhibit the innovation and insights that such exchange brings about.  Wholesale data localization also empowers national governments, and authoritarian states employ that tool to surveil their citizens\\' behavior, censor what they can see and hear, and identify and quell dissent.  That is hardly a recipe for protecting individual privacy.  And if those governments\\' citizens are using the Internet to commit crimes that victimize citizens of other nations, it can become very difficult for those victims, or their governments, to secure the evidence they need to achieve justice.', 'Our experience in law enforcement and with our law enforcement partners teaches that building legal barriers in the world of communications technology has real costs, perhaps none greater than the cost to our collective safety and security.  That is because the same modern technologies that make it possible to communicate instantly from almost anywhere on earth also make it easier than ever for criminals and terrorists to harm our citizens from abroad, behind layers of anonymity, at a keystroke.  The reality is, digital threats are growing in size and sophistication.  We need a global response.', 'Today, the United States enjoys a unique position with respect to communications data because much of it is stored within the United States or by providers based in the United States.  We understand that we may not be in the same position even a few years from now.  We now have an opportunity to lead proactively in this area and are prepared to work with our allies to build new mechanisms that appropriately balance privacy and public safety.', 'Recently, the Department of Justice was able to work with Congress, providers, academics, and others to develop a new approach that we hope will be a path forward for how countries can work together more efficiently to obtain critical evidence from increasingly global providers.  This new approach represents the first step towards an international system in which rights-respecting countries are able to obtain effective access to data to investigate serious crime, no matter where the data happens to be stored.', \"In charting this new path forward, several principles have guided us.  First, we need legal mechanisms that enable law enforcement in rights-respecting countries to lawfully obtain digital evidence as quickly as possible.  We must work to reduce delays in obtaining evidence critical to solving fast-moving investigations involving terrorism, computer intrusion, and child exploitation, to name just a few.  These delays are dangerous and harmful to the safety and security of any country's citizens.\", 'Second, reforming the mutual legal assistance process is only one part of the solution, for both the United States and our allies.  Under the MLA process, the evidence is often slow to arrive, even with our closest partners; and with others, it may not arrive at all.  In addition, our partners can struggle to understand and comply with the very high US legal standards for the evidence they seek.  We have begun and will continue to improve the MLA process, and we ask our partners to do the same.  But that is not a panacea.', \"Third, we must preserve an open and interoperable Internet.  As I've mentioned, data localization requirements are counterproductive.  They exacerbate conflicts of law, reduce the efficiency of Internet communications, impose costs on companies seeking to do business online, and will ultimately undermine individual privacy if data is moved to jurisdictions that lack robust due process protections.\", 'Finally, we cannot address existing conflicts of law--for example, situations where a communications provider is served with a lawful order by one democratic government demanding the production of data, but is barred from producing that data by the laws of the country in which the data is stored or where the provider is based--by creating new conflicts.  That is why we must avoid inflexible restraints on data transfers for law enforcement.  Instead, we should reduce potential conflicts where we can, including through bilateral agreements between rights-respecting countries that share robust privacy laws.  We can respect and improve safeguards for privacy and civil liberties without imposing a rigid, one-size-fits-all regime on countries that have their own legal traditions.  Indeed, we should support a flexible mechanism that can accommodate and respect different countries while still holding all of us to a rigorous, high standard.', \"Building upon these principles, the United States Congress recently passed, and the President signed into law, a statute that accomplishes these objectives in a way that is operationally sound, is privacy-enhancing, and is respectful of foreign sovereignty.  This law is known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or CLOUD Act.  I'd like to take a moment to explain to you exactly what it does.\", \"First, the CLOUD Act clarifies the obligation of communication service providers subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to produce data within their control in response to lawful US government warrants, no matter where they have chosen to store it.  This is not a new obligation.  In fact, until a recent (and now-vacated) court decision, this had long been the status quo under US law, and it is the same authority that other rights-respecting countries assert for themselves.  Indeed, under the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime--a nearly two-decades-old international treaty that provides an essential mechanism for cross-border cybercrime enforcement and electronic evidence sharing--more than fifty nations around the globe already have agreed that national laws should include the authority to compel providers in their territory to disclose data in the providers' possession and control, even when the data is held somewhere else.\", 'So let me underscore this key point: the CLOUD Act does not create any new legal requirements under either American or international law.  Neither does it in any way reduce the constitutional burden on American investigators, when seeking a warrant, to provide a sworn affidavit to the satisfaction of an impartial judge establishing both probable cause and particularity.    ', \"That brings me to a second major development in the CLOUD Act: the legislation establishes a new framework for bilateral agreements with our partners that directly addresses potential conflicts of law.  Under such agreements, each nation commits to removing legal impediments so that providers can comply with the other nation's lawful orders seeking communications data in investigations of serious crime.  For covered orders, no MLAT process would be required; legal process could be served directly on the provider, even though the data that is sought may be stored in the other country.  Again, the CLOUD Act does not impose any new obligations under US law.  Rather, a provider's obligations derive solely from the requesting country's law.\", \"It bears emphasizing that, in order to benefit from the CLOUD Act framework, a foreign country's orders must be in furtherance of serious criminal and terrorism investigations; and they may not target US persons or persons located in the United States. The statute also requires that implementing procedures and oversight measures be put in place to ensure this rule is followed.  In other words, this is not a blank check.\", \"A foreign country can qualify for a bilateral agreement under the CLOUD Act only if our Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, first certifies to Congress that the country has met robust obligations and commitments designed to protect privacy and civil liberties.  These commitments include laws that are compatible with the Budapest Convention; a demonstrated respect for the global free flow of information; and adherence to international human rights obligations, among other things.  In addition, that nation's orders must be subject to review or oversight by a court, judge, magistrate, or other independent authority; they may not be used to infringe freedom of speech; and they must be targeted at individual accounts.  Bulk surveillance is not permitted.\", 'Finally, let me underscore that the CLOUD Act involves data transfers for law enforcement purposes.  It does not undercut or create a conflict with the Privacy Shield framework, which provides a legal basis under EU law for transfers of data from the EU to registered US private companies.  The Privacy Shield framework of commercial data transfers is unrelated to, and unaffected by, the CLOUD Act.', 'As a whole, the CLOUD Act addresses both the conflicts that may arise when the United States seeks data abroad and when our foreign allies seek data located in the United States for law enforcement purposes.  Managing both sources of potential conflict simultaneously is critical.', 'We believe the CLOUD Act framework offers major benefits to our qualifying law enforcement partners.  It was enacted on the premise that, where our partners are more effective in investigating serious crime, we are all safer--especially in a world in which terrorism and many other criminal threats are transnational in nature.  I understand that the Act, as with any new legal regime, may not be well understood.  To be sure, there will be challenges in its implementation, and one of my goals today is to try to address some of the questions that we have received about the Act.', 'First, as you may know, the US government is already in the process of negotiating the first CLOUD Act agreement, with the United Kingdom.  This agreement would lift legal restrictions on providers that might prevent them from disclosing data directly to UK authorities for investigations of serious crime, including terrorism, where the UK has obtained authorization to access the data under its own laws.  Under the agreement, the United States would have reciprocal rights with respect to data subject to UK law. ', 'We hope to conclude this agreement first before entering into other bilateral agreements, and we expect to negotiate similar agreements with other privacy-respecting, rights-protecting governments around the world.  We have not yet begun negotiations with any other country, although there have been many expressions of interest.', \"Second, countries that are interested in negotiating a bilateral agreement should keep in mind the robust set of privacy and civil liberties protections I mentioned before, which are listed in the text of the statute.  We cannot execute an agreement with a country unless our Attorney General can certify, and provide a written explanation to Congress, that the country's legal system--both on paper, and in practice--meets those high thresholds.\", \"I have seen commentary suggesting that the CLOUD Act permits foreign countries that we execute an agreement with to potentially wiretap people located anywhere in the world, so long as the target of the wiretap is not a US person or located in the United States.  That is simply untrue.  As I've just mentioned, the statute requires that any country we enter into an agreement with has in place robust substantive and procedural protections for individual privacy and civil liberties.  These are the same standards our partners routinely apply when they seek wiretaps within their own countries and the data is accessible there.  Moreover, the CLOUD Act also requires heightened requirements specifically for a wiretap order, many of which mirror the heightened requirements for a wiretap order under US law.\", \"I've also heard the suggestion that the CLOUD Act allows the US government to engage in mass surveillance of other nation's citizens.  That, too, is simply incorrect.  As I emphasized before, this law does not in any way reduce the constitutional burden on American investigators, when seeking a warrant, to persuade a neutral judge that probable cause exists connecting the contents, say, of a particular email account to a specific crime.   \", 'Finally, any country that is interested in a bilateral agreement may wish carefully to consider the various provisions outlined in the CLOUD Act regarding the criteria that must be met with respect to a particular order requiring the production of electronic evidence.  For example, do the country\\'s orders require a showing based on articulable and credible facts, particularity, legality, and severity?  Can the country afford reciprocal rights of data access, including by removing any domestic legal restrictions it may have that would otherwise prevent communications providers from responding to valid legal process issued by the United States?  Can the country adopt and implement appropriate \"targeting and minimization\" procedures, which are designed to ensure that US persons or persons located in the United States are not targeted, and that any information concerning such persons that may incidentally be collected, is properly restricted?  Will the country submit to periodic review by the United States of its compliance with the terms of any bilateral agreement?  Of course, my government understands that we, too, have to be prepared to meet similar conditions with regard to our obligations under any agreement.', \"While the laws of some nations may already be sufficient to meet the requirements of the CLOUD Act, others may need to make modifications before they can become eligible for a bilateral agreement.  In fact, the United Kingdom undertook changes to its own laws in order to assure that it could comply with the CLOUD Act's requirements.  But I should emphasize that no one expects foreign countries to adhere to US laws governing US legal process.  Countries with sufficient civil liberties and privacy protections within their own system will be able to obtain data under this framework under their own legal standards.  Nonetheless, we expect that any interested country will make significant efforts to facilitate entering into an agreement, including by evaluating its own laws and by identifying and undertaking any necessary reforms in due course.\", \"Let me offer some concluding thoughts.  One of the enduring principles of any stable society is the responsibility of its government to protect its citizens.  In today's world, access to electronic evidence, wherever it may be stored, is a necessary means to fulfilling that solemn responsibility.  Countries with a commitment to human rights and civil liberties must work together in that endeavor, and not against one another.  We are at an important inflection point in building those cooperative relationships. The CLOUD Act offers that opportunity, and the United States stands ready to work with our partners to build new and efficient structures to enhance both privacy and public safety\"]\n"

      "['Remarks as prepared for delivery\\n ', 'It is an honor to join you for the 86th INTERPOL General Assembly. I would like to thank China for hosting this conference. I also want to thank President Meng and Secretary General Stock for inviting me to speak with you. Given the complex threats we face, INTERPOL\\'s support for law enforcement is more important than ever.\\nCriminals increasingly operate transnationally, with no respect for borders. Gang violence in one country causes trouble in a neighboring country. Drugs manufactured on one continent produce overdose deaths in another continent. Cyber hackers in one location wreak havoc on information systems in many distant locations. \\nWe must not allow criminals to use our borders to shield their illegal activities. To combat transnational crime, we must forge cross-border partnerships. By bridging geographic and political divides, INTERPOL helps law enforcement agencies build partnerships around common, crime-fighting priorities.  But to fully succeed, these partnerships must go beyond our law enforcement agencies.  In this regard, let me turn first to the interagency partnerships we need to fight terrorism.\\nPreventing foreign terrorist fighters from turning our homelands into battlefields is a priority we all share. As ISIS loses ground in Syria and Iraq, foreign fighters may return to their home countries or migrate to new ones. Terrorists bring with them their hate-filled ideologies. Just one terrorist, armed with a knife, a gun, or even a car, can turn our public squares, commercial centers, and places of worship into blood-stained crime scenes.\\nHow can we best confront the challenge? The answer is found in three core principles: collect, contribute, and compare. \\nThe first principle is to collect relevant information. Each member nation should collect biographic and biometric information to identify persons who enter its borders. And we need to periodically update that information to ensure that it remains accurate.\\nHow we organize this information is as important as its collection. It is vital that information be organized so that it can be effectively analyzed and shared, as appropriate. Within each country, we must break down compartmentalized barriers that restrict the free flow of data. Law enforcement and border security components of each nation must have access to the puzzle pieces necessary to detect the next threat. It took the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001 to help my country eliminate walls that hindered effective information sharing between the law enforcement and intelligence communities. We must all learn from the mistakes of our past. \\nThe second principle is to contribute information by sharing it with foreign partners that share our common goals. To fight transnational threats, it is not enough to collect and share information internally; we must also share it with other nations. INTERPOL has platforms that enable robust information sharing, which fuels multinational cooperation. The platforms allow nations to routinely contribute new data and records on everything from terrorist identities to lost or stolen travel documents. The platforms also permit nations to issue notices requesting assistance and to share information. That allows us to work together and identify threats from bad actors, including from foreign terrorist fighters. The better we collaborate, the more successful our terrorism prevention efforts will be.\\nThe third goal is to compare information and make sure that it is available for operational needs. Data is only helpful if it is used. To start, it is imperative that each INTERPOL member develop a robust screening and vetting system for persons entering its borders. In the United States, government agencies are working to improve our immigration screening and vetting capacities.  Our goal is to ensure that we welcome law-abiding visitors, but keep out those who seek to harm us. \\nWe must know the true identities of persons who enter our countries, so that we can determine whether they pose a danger to our citizens. We need to identify visitors and verify them with foreign nations that know them.  We need the ability to verify travelers through databases that include biographic and biometric data submitted through INTERPOL platforms. \\nRecurrent vetting is critical, because databases such as INTERPOL\\'s are constantly updated with additional information. Increased contributions from all member countries will enhance the security of all of our citizens. \\nFinally, with the authority to collect and share data about travelers comes the responsibility to use that data in a manner that respects privacy and civil liberties.  We must also design our border security policies and systems so as not to impose undue burdens on legitimate travel and commerce that is so critical to the global economy.  Reconciling these competing objectives is not always easy, but it is important that we do so in order to promote not only the security of our peoples but also their fundamental freedoms and prosperity.\\nThe potential benefits of the collect, contribute, and compare model are well illustrated through information-sharing from the military to law enforcement regarding terrorist identities. When coalition forces operate in conflict zones, they obtain valuable data about foreign terrorist fighters. The United States National Central Bureau is already obtaining, and sharing, this data via INTERPOL to law enforcement officers around the world.  We are helping them to identify terrorists and improve border security. Collectively, these projects provide a broad arsenal of tools to combat transnational threats to the national security of INTERPOL members.\\nOne example from the United States is a collaborative effort between the United States military, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States National Central Bureau. Through it, latent fingerprints collected from improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan have been shared with law enforcement partners through over 1,500 INTERPOL Blue Notices. This exchange enabled our partners to identify terrorist bomb makers inside Europe. These efforts can save many lives.\\nAnother collaborative initiative between the same U.S. agencies involves declassifying and sharing captured enemy materials obtained during military operations against terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. Identity information for more than 4,000 terrorist fighters and associates has been integrated into INTERPOL\\'s databases. \\nIn addition, Project VENNLIG, the original model for military-to-law-enforcement information exchange, has provided nations with documentation and data about foreign terrorist fighters. The project has already contributed to several dozen successful investigations in Europe and Africa. Because of this, the United States launched a new project, VENNLIG II, to take information collected by counter-ISIL forces and dispense the information through INTERPOL to police and border authorities. That information will help thwart travel or entry by foreign terrorist fighters, including fighters who pose as refugees. \\nThese projects underscore the potential for expanding the sources of information upon which we can draw to protect our borders and our citizens. But we can do more. \\nToday, I call on each of our members to encourage the leadership of your nation to fully integrate your INTERPOL National Central Bureaus with your law enforcement, border security, and immigration authorities.  That will enable you to create a comprehensive information-sharing system. \\nIncorporating access to INTERPOL\\'s global investigative indices into your national law enforcement and border screening platforms will enhance your ability to detect and stop international travel by criminals and terrorists.  It also will produce actionable intelligence about the identities, movements, and associations of transnational criminals and terrorists. \\nWe also can use INTERPOL notices to disseminate identity and biometric information, about suspected foreign terrorist fighters and associates, including fingerprints and photographs. By sharing that information with other nations, we can create a safer world for our citizens.\\nEach of us must make safety from transnational threats a top priority. There can be no safe haven for persons who want to harm our homelands. Some of our partner nations do not fully engage in the collect, contribute, and compare model. I encourage you to review your practices and ensure that safety is not being compromised. We must know who is entering and leaving our borders, and whether they intend to cause harm. \\nPrivacy protections are important and should be respected. The right and need of each nation to police its own borders can be done in a privacy-protective manner, as INTERPOL demonstrates every day.\\nOur partnerships must also extend outside government, and  in a way that protects individual rights.  Law enforcement authorities have dual obligations. They are responsible for protecting public safety and for protecting the civil liberties - including privacy rights -- of citizens. Fulfilling those responsibilities is a continuing challenge. \\nAn established rule-of-law system is vital for adjudicating competing interests between protecting the privacy of personal data and obtaining access to that data for law enforcement purposes. A respected rule-of-law system is essential when interacting with technology providers, and other holders of personal data.\\nIn our interconnected world, electronically stored evidence is increasingly critical in law enforcement investigations. Without it, criminals frequently cannot be identified, much less prosecuted. Relevant information often resides in the control of private companies. The question is how to obtain the information.\\nIt would not be wise for law enforcement agencies to attempt to unilaterally force private industry to do their bidding without independent review. If law enforcement could obtain what it wants, when it wants it, that would come at an unacceptable cost to individual liberty. Without adequate checks to prevent government overreach, the privacy of citizens would not be protected. \\nThe better approach - used in the United States and many other countries -- is to rely on the rule of law and an independent judiciary to balance the needs of law enforcement with the privacy rights of individuals. In many cases, our Constitution or our laws require us to obtain judicial approval before we can gain access to private information.  Our law enforcement agencies do not always get exactly what they want. Through a fair and transparent rule-of-law system, courts can protect the privacy of individuals while providing law enforcement agencies access to the information they need. \\nSince its founding, the United States has turned to the rule of law to balance the competing interests in security and privacy. \\nThe United States Constitution is our foundational charter. Last weekend, we celebrated the 230th anniversary of the date that our Constitution was written at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Constitution was adopted by our people in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. It established a democratic republic designed to protect the rights of our people.\\nThe United States Constitution is a framework that has served us well and served as a model for many other nations.\\nThe rights protected by our Constitution include a requirement that the government act reasonably when seizing evidence, and a prohibition on infringing the right of our people to speak freely without fear of governmental retaliation.\\nThe Constitution establishes three separate branches of government. Each has a unique role, allowing it to serve in part as a check on the others. The legislature passes laws. The executive enforces them. And the independent judiciary interprets them. \\nOur laws include provisions that regulate government access to electronic communications and records held by third-party communication providers. The laws require the government to provide greater justification when it seeks more sensitive categories of information. Courts oversee the execution of these laws. Impartial judges decide whether the government satisfies the evidentiary thresholds required to obtain access to the information. \\nOur rule-of-law system for accessing data held by third parties functions well because of an independent judiciary that balances the need for public safety with a customer\\'s legitimate expectation of privacy. It enables law enforcement to access critical data that is used to catch criminals and prevent crime. \\nAs a result of technological developments, this system now faces challenges, with growing implications for our ability to protect our citizens and to hold criminal and terrorists accountable. \\nThe first challenge is locating the data.   Increasingly, technology providers may store data in overseas locations. This presents the issue of cross-border access to data, an issue that is being discussed both in multilateral fora, and in the legislatures and courts of many countries. \\nEven when all the data is stored in a single jurisdiction, technology providers sometimes may be slow to respond to court orders. Such delays impede investigations, making it harder to solve crimes and prevent future crimes. Law enforcement can seek court assistance to require technology providers to comply, but such motions take time and resources  and relief may not always be granted.\\nEnd-to-end encryption, sometimes known as \"Going Dark,\" is another challenge.  Encryption serves important privacy and security interests.  But it is also critical that law enforcement, with independent judicial oversight and authorization, have access to data for law enforcement purposes. In recent years, technology providers have increasingly shifted to a business model that prevents law enforcement agencies from accessing data even with a court order. As a result, technology providers, not courts or policymakers, in effect are deciding whether law enforcement agencies can access evidence critical to investigations. \\nWe all share many of these challenges. We should work together to find solutions.\\nFirst and foremost, we should resolve to address problems through a transparent rule-of-law system that respects individual rights and gives appropriate weight to legitimate law enforcement needs.\\nI have spoken about how my country operates. We do not all need to adopt the same approach. What works best for one nation may not work best for another. But I encourage each country to commit to safeguarding individual liberty, without denying law enforcement access to the information needed to solve crimes. That requires involvement by a neutral official who gives appropriate consideration to privacy interests. \\nWhere technological business models hinder transnational investigations, we must cooperate across borders to obtain necessary evidence. \\nIf we lose evidence to encryption, we should work together to compensate for it through other means. For example, if a suspect has encrypted incriminating text messages about Brazilian financial dealings by a German citizen, we may not be able to obtain the communications. However, we can work with German authorities to interview the suspect and with Brazilian law enforcement to obtain financial records. Through such steps, we can keep investigations moving forward, despite technological barriers.\\nThis stopgap approach, however, is not a substitute for a long-term answer. To obtain support for a workable solution, we should keep our citizens and policymakers informed about the consequences of denying law enforcement access to critical evidence. \\nWe also should take steps to prevent technology providers from circumventing the rule of law and foreclosing access to relevant evidence. We must ensure that electronically stored evidence remains available to law enforcement, through voluntary cooperation whenever possible, and through legislation and litigation otherwise. \\nWhen evidence is stored in multiple countries, we must share that evidence through law-enforcement-to-law-enforcement channels, whenever possible. When court orders are required, we must timely seek such orders, consistent with mutual legal assistance treaties. All nations should devote appropriate resources to process legal assistance requests in a timely manner.\\nBecause many technology providers are headquartered in the United States, we receive a substantial number of requests for assistance. To address these requests, we recently increased the staffing at our Office of International Affairs - our central authority -- and streamlined our review processes. As a result, we granted five times as many foreign assistance requests in 2016 as in 2013.\\nWe must all devote more resources to the task, because an increasing volume of Internet-related crime means there is a need for access to an increasing volume of electronically stored evidence. \\nJustice delayed is justice denied. Each nation must ensure that its central authority is adequately staffed with experienced professionals. And those central authorities must be empowered to act. The safety of our countries depends on fast and effective cooperation.\\nIn cases where private companies resist valid requests for assistance, we must enforce those requests when consistent with the rule of law. Respect for the rule of law requires obedience to court orders.\\nWe must all ensure that our countries are availing themselves of existing multilateral instruments and mechanisms to fight cybercrime.  I call on all nations that have not already done so to consider joining the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.  It is a highly effective convention that ensures that cybercrime is subject to effective criminal sanctions in each country and that a mutual legal assistance relationship exists among all member countries.  In addition, I urge countries to join the 24/7 High Tech Network, which ensures that critical cyber evidence can be preserved for use in investigations and prosecutions. Experts in the United States Department of Justice would be pleased to discuss with you the importance and value of the Budapest Convention and the 24/7 High Tech Network.\\nFinally, allow me to address a matter of immediate concern to many of us.  The INTERPOL model of law enforcement cooperation works because each INTERPOL member focuses solely on combatting transnational crime.  \\nOther international bodies should address the controversial political issues that arise in international affairs.  INTERPOL must remain resolutely non-political. We must focus, without distraction, on fighting transnational threats through law enforcement partnerships. I urge all member nations not to make this organization a political body where we argue about which regions deserve recognition as nations.  At the very least, a vote on the admission of new members should occur only after all current members have sufficient time to study the new criteria and apply them carefully. And the criteria, consistent with INTERPOL\\'s mission, must include the authority to control defined borders, and the authority to enter into relationships with other states.\\nAllow me to conclude with a reminder about the importance of international collaboration, and a commitment from the United States. Transnational threats affect us all. Forging partnerships across interagency lines, and across borders is critical to our common success.  That is why I am pleased to be with you today. INTERPOL is a model of how we can work together, to protect our citizens and our civil liberties. \\nThe United States stands ready to work with every country that is committed to those goals. Thank you for your partnership and your attention.\\n ']\n",

      "['Fuyi Sun, aka \"Frank,\" 53, a citizen of the People\\'s Republic of China (\"China\"), pleaded guilty today to violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in connection with a scheme to illegally export to China, without a license, high-grade carbon fiber, which is used primarily in aerospace and military applications.', 'The announcement was made by Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Mary B. McCord and Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim for the Southern District of New York. The plea was entered before U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.', '\"Today, Sun admitted to attempting to procure high-grade carbon fiber - which has sophisticated aerospace and defense applications - for the Chinese military. The defendant was willing to pay a premium to evade U.S. export laws and illegally transfer this highly protected material,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord. \"The National Security Division will continue to identify those who violate IEEPA and other laws that protect our national assets from reaching the hands of potential adversaries.\"', '\"As Fuyi Sun admitted today in court, he tried to skirt U.S. export laws by hiding his purchase of high-grade carbon fiber for the Chinese military. Sun used fraudulent documents and code words in his efforts to obtain this highly protected material, which is used in aerospace and defense programs, and to avoid detection,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Kim. \"Together with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to enforce the laws that protect our national security.\"', \"According to the allegations contained in the Complaint and the Indictment filed against Sun and statements made in court filings and proceedings, including today's guilty plea: \", 'Since approximately 2011, Sun has attempted to acquire extremely high-grade carbon fiber, including Toray type M60JB-3000-50B carbon fiber (\"M60 Carbon Fiber\"). M60 Carbon Fiber has applications in aerospace technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly known as drones) and other government defense applications. Accordingly, M60 Carbon Fiber is strictly controlled - including that it requires a license for export to China - for nuclear non-proliferation and anti-terrorism reasons.', 'In furtherance of his attempts to illegally export M60 Carbon Fiber from the U.S. to China without a license, Sun contacted what he believed was a distributor of carbon fiber - but which was, in fact, an undercover entity created by HSI and \"staffed\" by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\\'s Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) undercover special agents (the \"UC Company\"). Sun inquired about purchasing the M60 Carbon Fiber without the required license. In the course of his years\\' long communications with the undercover agents and UC Company, Sun repeatedly suggested various security measures that he believed would protect them from \"U.S. intelligence.\" ', 'Among other such measures, at one point, Sun instructed the undercover agents to use the term \"banana\" instead of \"carbon fiber\" in their communications. Consequently, soon thereafter he inquired about purchasing 450 kilograms of \"banana\" for more than $62,000. In order to avoid detection, Sun also suggested removing the identifying barcodes for the M60 Carbon Fiber, prior to transshipment, and further suggested that they identify the M60 Carbon Fiber as \"acrylic fiber\" in customs documents.', \"On April 11, 2016, Sun traveled from China to New York for the purpose of purchasing M60 Carbon Fiber from the UC Company. During meetings with the undercover agents, on or about April 11 and 12, among other things, Sun repeatedly suggested that the Chinese military was the ultimate end-user for the M60 Carbon Fiber he sought to acquire from the UC Company, and claimed to have personally worked in the Chinese missile program. Sun further asserted that he maintained a close relationship with the Chinese military, had a sophisticated understanding of the Chinese military's need for carbon fiber, and suggested that he would be supplying the M60 Carbon Fiber to the Chinese military or to institutions closely associated with it.\", 'On April 12, 2016, Sun agreed to purchase two cases of M60 Carbon Fiber from the UC Company. On that date, Sun paid the undercover agents purporting to represent the UC Company $23,000 in cash for the carbon fiber, as well as an additional $2,000 as compensation for the risk he believed the UC Company was taking to illegally export the carbon fiber to China without a license. Sun was arrested the next day on April 13, 2016.', 'Attempting to violate IEEPA carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes.

', '\"This prosecution is the result of a vigorous and ongoing investigation into traffickers profiting from endangered and precious wildlife species,\" said Assistant Attorney General Cruden.  \"We must ensure that the market for antiques and alleged antiques does not also contribute to the extinction of these iconic animals, which could disappear in our lifetimes if we do not act now to stop this illegal trade.\"', '\"This defendant flouted the laws established to protect endangered wildlife,\" said U.S. Attorney Bharara.  \"Willfully failing to declare the nature of the shipments or obtain required permits, Liao broke laws that protect rhinoceros and other magnificent species threatened with extinction.  He has learned the cost of his illegal conduct.\"', '\"Each of the ceremonial cups that Liao trafficked represents one step closer to extinction for the rhinoceros, which are steadily being wiped out by poachers for the illegal rhino horn market,\" said Director Ashe.  \"The seriousness of this crime and others like it and their consequences for the world\\'s most imperiled species are what drives our efforts to root out and shut down illegal operators like Mr. Liao.  This sentence will serve as a strong warning that we are going to find, arrest and prosecute anyone engaged in this sort of activity and make sure they are no longer able to deprive our children and grandchildren of their wildlife inheritance.\"', \"According to the information, other documents filed in federal court in Manhattan and statements made at various proceedings in this case, including today's sentencing:\", 'Liao was arrested in February 2015 as part of \"Operation Crash,\" a nationwide crackdown on illegal trafficking in rhinoceros horns.  Liao was a partner in an Asian art and antiques business located in China.  Liao\\'s role was to purchase items, including wildlife items, in the United States and arrange for their export to China.  Between in or about March 2012 and May 2013, Liao made online purchases of 16 rhinoceros horn products, more specifically libation cups, from auction houses in the United States, including in Manhattan, which he then smuggled to China without the required declarations and permits.  In order to make these purchases, Liao used an address of his family members in New Jersey, the New Jersey location, because he knew that absent a domestic address, the auction houses would not ship him the rhinoceros horn as well as ivory that Liao had acquired.  Liao then utilized a Manhattan-based courier service to illegally export the merchandise to China.  Liao did not declare the rhinoceros exports to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or obtain the required permits despite his knowledge of the need to do so.  Liao closely coordinated his efforts with co-conspirators who sold the items for a profit at their antique business in China.  The market value of the rhinoceros libation cups in this case is more than $1 million.    ', 'The rhinoceros is an herbivore species of prehistoric origin and one of the largest remaining mega-fauna on earth.  They have no known predators other than humans.  All species of rhinoceros are protected under U.S. and international law.  Since 1976, trade in rhinoceros horn has been regulated under CITES, a treaty signed by over 170 countries around the world to protect fish, wildlife and plants that are or may become imperiled due to the demands of international markets.  Rhinoceros are also protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which further regulates trade and transport.', 'In addition to his prison term, Liao was also ordered two years of supervised release, to forfeit $1 million and 304 pieces of carved ivory found during a search of the New Jersey location.  Liao was also banned from future involvement in the wildlife trade.', 'Operation Crash is a continuing investigation by the Department of the Interior\\'s Fish and Wildlife Service, in coordination with the Department of Justice.  A \"crash\" is the term for a herd of rhinoceros.  Operation Crash is an ongoing effort to detect, deter and prosecute those engaged in the illegal killing of rhinoceros and the unlawful trafficking of rhinoceros horns.', \"Assistant Attorney General Cruden and U.S. Attorney Bharara thanked the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for its outstanding work in this investigation.  This case is being prosecuted by the Office's Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Gachiri and Senior Litigation Counsel Richard A. Udell with the Environmental Crimes Section of the Department of Justice are in charge of the prosecution.\", 'In addition to his prison term, Liao was also ordered two years of supervised release, to forfeit $1 million and 304 pieces of carved ivory found during a search of the New Jersey location.

In addition, from August 2009 through December 2012, Picone owned and operated Epic International Electronics (Epic) and served as its president and director. ', \"In connection with his guilty plea, Picone admitted that, from February 2007 through April 2012, first through Titronix and later through Epic, he purchased millions of dollars' worth of ICs bearing the counterfeit marks of approximately 35 major electronics manufacturers, including Motorola, Xilinx and National Semiconductor, from suppliers in China and Hong Kong.  Picone admitted that he resold the counterfeit ICs to customers both in the United States and abroad, including to defense contractors that Picone knew intended to supply the counterfeit ICs to the U.S. Navy for use in nuclear submarines, among other things.  Picone further admitted that he knew that malfunction or failure of the ICs likely would cause impairment of combat operations and other significant harm to national security.\", \"On April 24, 2012, federal agents searched Picone's business and residence, and recovered 12,960 counterfeit ICs.  In connection with his guilty plea, Picone admitted that he intended to sell the seized counterfeit ICs to defense contractors doing business with the Navy for use in military applications.\", \"The case was investigated by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the NCIS and ICE-HSI.

      "['  Thank you, [Kimberly Parker of Wilmer Hale], for that kind introduction.  I appreciate your warm welcome, and I am so pleased to be here today to address this audience.', \"  I began my career as a federal prosecutor almost 17 years ago in the Justice Department's Criminal Division, and I have been honored, over the last several months, to serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Division.  The work of the Criminal Division is extraordinarily wide-ranging - from fighting financial fraud, to dismantling drug cartels, combating cybercrime, and prosecuting dangerous organized crime groups.  Today, I want to focus my remarks on one of our most important enforcement priorities - our efforts to combat corruption around the world. \", \"  Corruption corrodes the public trust in countries both rich and poor, and inflicts particular harm on emerging economies.  When a developing country's public officials abuse their power for personal gain, its people suffer.  Political institutions lose legitimacy, threatening democratic stability and the rule of law; and people lose hope that they will ever be able to improve their lot.  When corruption takes hold, the fundamental notion of playing-by-the-rules gets pushed to the side, and individuals, businesses and governments instead begin to operate under a fundamentally unfair - and destabilizing - set of norms.  This undermines confidence in the markets and governments, and destroys the sense of fair play that is absolutely critical for the rule of law to prevail.\", '  For these reasons, fighting global corruption is, and always will be, a core priority of the Department of Justice.  Since 2005, the Department has secured close to three dozen corporate guilty pleas in FCPA cases.  And just since 2009, the Department has entered into over 40 corporate resolutions, including nine of the top 10 biggest resolutions ever in terms of penalties, resulting in approximately $2.5 billion in monetary fines.  And, perhaps most important, in that same period, we have successfully secured the convictions of over three dozen individuals for engaging in foreign bribery schemes. ', '  Our recent string of successful prosecutions of corporate executives is worth highlighting.  Those actions show, in concrete terms, that we are not going away - indeed, our efforts to fight foreign bribery are more robust than ever.  By redoubling our commitment to bring to justice those individuals who bribe for business, we are sending an unmistakable message to corporate executives around the world - if you engage in corrupt conduct, you should be prepared to face very real consequences, including jail time. ', '  Our enforcement record in this area speaks for itself.  In just the last two months, in federal districts across the country, we have announced charges or guilty pleas against 12 executives and others on foreign bribery-related charges:', '  * In Tulsa, Okla., we announced charges against four former executives of BizJet International, an aircraft services company, for participating in a scheme to pay bribes to government officials in Latin America;', '  * In federal court in New York, we charged a French citizen with attempting to obstruct an ongoing investigation into whether a company paid bribes to win lucrative mining rights in the Republic of Guinea;', '  * In Connecticut, we announced charges against one current and one former executive, and secured a guilty plea from another former executive of a U.S. subsidiary of a French power and transportation company that paid bribes to Indonesian officials;', '  * In Houston, we secured a 15-month prison sentence against a former consultant for Willbros International Inc. for his role in a conspiracy to pay more than $6 million in bribes to Nigerian government and political party officials; and', \"  * And, in Manhattan, we charged three employees of a U.S. broker-dealer - including one just last week - as well as a senior official in Venezuela's state economic development bank for their roles in a bribery scheme designed to steer the state bank's financial trading business to the broker-dealer.\", '  The message to be drawn from these prosecutions over the last few months is clear:  we are now - more than ever - holding individual wrongdoers to account.', \"  In addition to our stepped-up prosecutions of individuals, our recent enforcement actions against French oil and gas company Total highlight another important shift in the anti-corruption realm - the development of stronger anti-bribery enforcement programs in foreign countries, the continuing and encouraging rise in cross-border cooperation, and the increasing efforts of our foreign law enforcement partners to hold individual perpetrators accountable.  Just this last month, on the same day that the Justice Department and SEC resolved criminal and civil foreign bribery charges with Total, French enforcement authorities requested that Total, Total's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and two additional individuals be referred to the French Criminal Court for violations of French law, including France's foreign bribery law.  The Total case represents the first ever coordinated action by U.S. and French law enforcement in a foreign bribery case; and because of that close collaboration, Total now faces criminal consequences across two continents.  This unprecedented, joint action by U.S. and French authorities reflects our renewed commitment to work as closely as we can with our foreign counterparts to stamp out bribery across the globe.    Meanwhile, countries around the world are passing new anti-bribery legislation, or revising outdated laws, and more countries are joining international bodies such as the OECD Working Group on Bribery.  And each day, more countries are joining the fight.  Just in the past few years, Russia and China have outlawed foreign bribery, and India may soon join that list.  Earlier this year, Colombia became the 40th party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.  Through our increased work on prosecutions with our foreign counterparts and our participation in various multi-lateral fora like the OECD and United Nations, it is safe to say that we are cooperating with foreign law enforcement on foreign bribery cases more closely today than at any time in history.\", '  This type of collaboration is absolutely critical if we are going to have a meaningful impact on corruption internationally.  As our economies become more interdependent, corruption itself is increasingly transnational.  What may be a domestic corruption concern for one country may very well be a foreign bribery concern for another. ', '  Of course, the upsurge in foreign enforcement and global collaboration did not happen overnight or by accident.  It is, instead, the product of hard work and strategic coordination - including face-to-face engagements that have allowed us to forge the partnerships that are essential to fight global corruption.  In February of this year, for example, the Justice Department, SEC, and FBI hosted about 130 judges, prosecutors, investigators, and regulators from more than 30 countries, multi-development banks, and international organizations around the world for a training course to exchange ideas and best practices on combating foreign corruption.  This unprecedented meeting provided a critical opportunity to meet our partners, discuss cases, identify new opportunities to collaborate, and improve our intelligence sharing.  Needless to say, we were able to advance a number of specific prosecutions through that meeting and, as important, forge new bonds with an entire generation of prosecutors dedicated to combating global corruption.', \"  These day-to-day efforts by the Justice Department and our counterparts around the world might not be visible to the public, but the fruits of these efforts are.  Many of you have heard, for example, of the Siemens prosecution, which began with dawn raids not by U.S. authorities, but by the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office.  And long before the U.K. Bribery Act was even proposed, we were working together with the U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office to bring cases against U.S. and U.K. companies alike, as well as their executives and agents involved in bribery schemes.  Our friends in Canada, meanwhile, have also increased their anti-corruption resources with two Royal Canadian Mounted Police units focused on international corruption, and the results speak for themselves with two major cases being brought against Niko Resources and Griffiths International in the past few years.  We have worked with our partners in Thailand on the Gerald and Patricia Green case, involving bribes paid to a Thai official in exchange for a series of government contracts; and in Costa Rica, on the Sapsizian and Alcatel matters, we worked with our partners to prosecute cases involving corrupt payments to Costa Rican government officials, including the payment of bribes to obtain a mobile telephone contract from the state-owned telecommunications authority.  All of these prosecutions are a testament to what we can do when we work hand-in-glove with our foreign partners.\", '  Another important manifestation of our international collaboration on foreign bribery is the peer-review monitoring system of the OECD Working Group on Bribery, which is considered by Transparency International to be the \"gold standard\" of monitoring, and has resulted in remarkable improvements in anti-bribery enforcement around the world.  This review process is rigorous, and we see our role in this process to be mission critical, as it is one of the best ways to level the playing field for U.S. companies doing business abroad.  In fact, just last month, we sent a seasoned foreign bribery prosecutor to Moscow to help lead the Phase 2 review of Russia, and we will be sending another foreign bribery prosecutor to review South Africa, the only country in Africa to be a member of the Working Group on Bribery. ', \"  But we do more than conduct reviews; we are subject to them, too.  In October 2010, we underwent a Working Group review, and one of the recommendations from that report was part of the impetus behind the Justice Department's and SEC's Resource Guide to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The Guide may be the most comprehensive effort ever undertaken by either the Justice Department or the SEC to explain our approach to enforcing a particular statute.  And, we have received extremely positive reviews about the Guide from the business and legal communities.  In particular, we have heard praise from numerous compliance and ethics officers, who have focused on our Ten Hallmarks of an Effective Compliance Program and have even told us that they are incorporating the Guide into their in-house training programs.\", \"  All of these achievements are the product of years of work by a talented corps of dedicated and tenacious prosecutors in the Criminal Division's Fraud Section, who team up with similarly committed prosecutors in United States Attorneys' Offices throughout the country to enforce the FCPA.  Simply put, our global anti-corruption mission is now ingrained in the Criminal Division's DNA, and the FCPA is now a reality that companies know they must live with and adjust to; and this nation, and the world, are better off for it.  Notably, moreover, our FCPA prosecutors are not alone in our fight against corruption.  Our Public Integrity Section, everyday, prosecutes corruption cases involving federal, state, and local officials - indeed, just last week, our Public Integrity prosecutors secured an important conviction against former Congressman Richard Renzi.  And, through our Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, prosecutors in our Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section are working to identify the proceeds of foreign official corruption, seize them, and repatriate the recouped funds for the benefit of the people harmed.  And our Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development and Training, known as OPDAT, and our International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, known as ICITAP, deploy prosecutors and police officers around the globe to establish rule of law programs and ensure - through those programs and training - that corruption does not take hold.  \", \"  As head of the Criminal Division, I am acutely aware that we have many urgent law enforcement priorities - indeed, every day, our prosecutors work to combat violent crime, financial fraud, cybercrime, and organized crime.  Yet, even with all these competing demands, I am here to tell you that fighting global corruption will remain a mainstay of the Criminal Division's mission.  Indeed, with the momentum of so many countries behind us, I am certain that now is the time to enhance, not diminish, our anti-corruption efforts.  The fight against global corruption is a critical mission, and one I'm very proud to be part of.\", '   Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today.  It has been a privilege to be here.']\n",

The defendants were indicted in the Eastern District of Michigan in December 2007.', \"  Ralsky served as the chief executive officer and primary deal maker for the spam e-mail operation. Bradley, Ralsky's son-in-law, served as the chief financial officer and director of operations for the spam e-mail operation. Bown, who was chief executive officer of an Internet services company, GDC Layer One, served as the chief technology officer for the spam e-mail operation. William Neil, who was an employee of GDC Layer One, built and maintained a computer network used to transmit spam e-mails as part of the conspiracy. Fite was a contract spammer who hired others to send spam e-mails as part of the conspiracy.\", '  Devenow, Hui and Tribble previously pleaded guilty for their roles in the conspiracy. Devenow served as a manager for the spam e-mail operation and also sent spam e-mails. Tribble planned and directed the stock trading carried out in furtherance of the conspiracy. Hui, who was the CEO of China World Trade, served as the lead dealmaker representing the companies whose stocks were being promoted via spam e-mail.', '  According to court documents, many of the spam e-mails promoted thinly traded \"pink sheet\" stocks for U.S. companies owned and controlled by individuals in Hong Kong and China. The spam e-mails contained materially false and misleading information or omissions and were created and sent using software programs that made it difficult to trace them back to the conspirators. According to the indictment, the conspirators used wire communications, the U.S. mail and common carriers to further their frauds. The conspirators also engaged in money laundering involving millions of dollars generated by their manipulative stock trading.', '  According to the indictment, the defendants used various illegal methods in order to maximize the amount of spam that evaded spam-blocking devices and tricked recipients into opening, and acting on, the advertisements in the spam. These included using falsified \"headers\" in the e-mail messages, using proxy computers to relay the spam, using falsely registered domain names to send the spam, and also making misrepresentations in the advertising content of some of the underlying e-mail messages.', '  The cases against Anki Neil, Bragg and Severa are still pending. An indictment is merely an accusation and defendants are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty at trial beyond a reasonable doubt.', \"  The charges arose after a three-year investigation, led by the FBI with assistance from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and IRS-CI revealed a sophisticated and extensive spamming operation. The case is being prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Terrence Berg and Trial Attorneys Thomas Dukes and Mona Sedky Spivack of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.\"]\n"
